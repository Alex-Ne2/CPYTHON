This directory contains a number of Python programs that are useful
while building or extending Python.

build           Build-time toolkit for detecting and handling/preventing 
                various file and formatting errors.

buildbot        Batchfiles for running on Windows buildbot workers.

c-analyzer      Converter functions for primitive type casting and creating 
                new docstrings.

cases_generator Parses instruction definitions from Python/bytecodes.c, 
                writes each generated case to Python/generated_cases.c.h.

ccbench         A Python threads-based concurrency benchmark. (*)

clinic          Preprocessor for CPython C files. Automates all the 
                boilerplates involved with writing argument parsing 
                code for builtins and providing introspection signatures 
                ("docstrings") for CPython builtins.

freeze          Create a stand-alone executable from a Python program.

gdb             Python code to be run inside gdb, to make it easier to
                debug Python itself (by David Malcolm).

i18n            Tools for internationalization. pygettext.py
                parses Python source code and generates .pot files,
                and msgfmt.py generates a binary message catalog
                from a catalog in text format.
                
importbench     A set of micro-benchmarks for various import scenarios.
                Can be used to to measure impact of possible code changes.

iobench         Benchmark for the new Python I/O system. (*)

msi             Support for packaging Python as an MSI package on Windows.

nuget           Builds NuGet packages for CPython.

patchcheck      Checks for common issues in the proposed changes of a 
                given code patch.

peg_generator   PEG-based parser generator (pegen) used for new parser.

scripts         A number of useful single-file programs, e.g. tabnanny.py
                by Tim Peters, which checks for inconsistent mixing of
                tabs and spaces, and 2to3, which converts Python 2 code
                to Python 3 code.
                
ssl             Runs Python tests against multiple installations of OpenSSL 
                and LibreSSL. Contains tools to download the 
                OpenSSL/LibreSSL tar bundle.

stringbench     A suite of micro-benchmarks for various operations on
                strings (both 8-bit and unicode). (*)
                
tz              Time Zone Database (tz) dump module. Enables reading from
                /usr/share/zoneinfo to obtain zone data.

unicode         Tools for generating unicodedata and codecs from unicode.org
                and other mapping files (by Fredrik Lundh, Marc-Andre Lemburg
                and Martin von Loewis).

unittestgui     A Tkinter based GUI test runner for unittest, with test
                discovery.
                
wasm            Tools for facilitating cross-compilation of CPython to 
                WebAssmebly (WASM).
