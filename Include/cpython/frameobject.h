/* Starting in CPython 3.11, CPython separates the frame state between the
 * full frame objects exposed by the Python and C runtime state introspection
 * APIs, and internal lighter weight frame data structs, which are simple C
 * structures owned by either the interpreter eval loop (while executing
 * ordinary functions), by a generator or coroutine object (for frames that
 * are able to be suspended), or by their corresponding full frame object (if
 * a state instrospection API has been invoked and the full frame object has
 * taken responsibility for the lifecycle of the frame data storage).
 *
 * This split storage eliminates a lot of allocation and deallocation of full
 * Python objects during code execution, providing a significant speed gain
 * over the previous approach of using full Python objects for both
 * introspection and code execution.
