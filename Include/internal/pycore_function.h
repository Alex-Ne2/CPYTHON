/* Static method object */

/* A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
   To declare a static method, use this idiom:

     class C:
         @staticmethod
         def f(arg1, arg2, ...):
             ...

   It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
   (e.g. C().f()). Both the class and the instance are ignored, and
   neither is passed implicitly as the first argument to the method.

   Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++.
   For a more advanced concept, see class methods above.

/* Class method object */

/* A class method receives the class as implicit first argument,
   just like an instance method receives the instance.
   To declare a class method, use this idiom:

     class C:
         @classmethod
         def f(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
             ...

   It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
   (e.g. C().f()); the instance is ignored except for its class.
   If a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class
   object is passed as the implied first argument.

   Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods.
   If you want those, see static methods below.
