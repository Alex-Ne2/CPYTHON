Found a issue

when i use the code

a = 1
b = input("enter a number")
sum = b + b
print(sum)





output shows
enter a number : a
2

when user input value a then the input function works like b = a
but the output i expect is a error, because input function in python 2.7 can only have int value
the above code (b = input("")) is working as b = a
