prelude: |
  Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section
  for this release. All of the prelude content is merged together
  and then rendered separately from the items listed in other parts
  of the file, so the text needs to be worded so that both the
  prelude and the other items make sense when read
  independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every
  release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing
  major features or adding release theme details should have a
  prelude.
