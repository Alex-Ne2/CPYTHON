timeit now repeats the benchmarks 5 times instead of only 3 to make benchmarks
more reliable. In addition autorange now uses a single loop iteration if the
benchmark takes less than 10 seconds, instead of 10 iterations.
"python3 -m timeit -s 'import time' 'time.sleep(1)'" now takes 4 seconds
instead of 40 seconds.
