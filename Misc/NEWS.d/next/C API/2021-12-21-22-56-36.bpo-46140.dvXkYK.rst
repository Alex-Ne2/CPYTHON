``PyBuffer_GetPointer``, ``PyBuffer_FromContiguous``, ``PyBuffer_ToContiguous`` and ``PyMemoryView_FromBuffer`` now take buffer info by const ``Py_buffer *`` instead of ``Py_buffer *``, as they do not need mutability. ``PyBuffer_FromContiguous`` also now takes the source buffer as ``const void *``, and similarly ``PyBuffer_GetPointer`` takes the strides as ``const Py_ssize_t *``.
