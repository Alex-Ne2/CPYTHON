Add public functions operating on ``Py_complex`` numbers:

* :c:func:`Py_complex_sum`: previously known as ``_Py_c_sum()``
* :c:func:`Py_complex_diff`: previously known as ``_Py_c_diff()``
* :c:func:`Py_complex_neg`: previously known as ``_Py_c_neg()``
* :c:func:`Py_complex_prod`: previously known as ``_Py_c_prod()``
* :c:func:`Py_complex_quot`: previously known as ``_Py_c_quot()``
* :c:func:`Py_complex_pow`: previously known as ``_Py_c_pow()``
* :c:func:`Py_complex_abs`: previously known as ``_Py_c_abs()``

The old names with the ``_Py_c`` prefix are kept for backward compatibility.
