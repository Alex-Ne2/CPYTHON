Add :c:func:`PyErr_GetRaisedException` and :c:func:`PyErr_SetRaisedException`
for saving and restoring the current exception.
These functions take and return a single exception,
rather than the triple arguments of the now deprecated
:c:func:`PyErr_Fetch` and :c:func:`PyErr_Restore`.
This is less error prone and a bit more efficient.

Also add :c:func:`PyException_GetArgs` and :c:func:`PyException_SetArgs`
as convenience functions for dealing with exceptions in the C API.
