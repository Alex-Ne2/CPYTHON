Conflict because of "slots", when both CPython and Qt headers are included in client code was fixed. Actually this problem had been fixed once in Issue1086854 , but later it was introduced again in the ``PyType_Spec`` struct in commit 4d0d471a8031de90a2b1ce99c4ac4780e60b3bc . This is a **compatibility break** for code which uses ``PyType_Spec`` struct members.
