Disallowing subprocess in subinterpreters is no longer supported. Instead,
``os.exec()`` can now be disallowed.  Disallowing daemon threads is now
supported.  Disallowing all threads is still allowed, but is never done by
default.  Note that the options are only available through
``_Py_NewInterpreterFromConfig()``, which isn't a public API.
