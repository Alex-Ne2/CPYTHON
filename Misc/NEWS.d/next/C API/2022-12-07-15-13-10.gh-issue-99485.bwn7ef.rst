Remove untested functions which were used to create generators and
coroutines:

* ``PyAsyncGen_New()``
* ``PyCoro_New()``
* ``PyGen_New()``
* ``PyGen_NewWithQualName()``

Since 3.11, these functions can no longer be used in practice, because there
is no public C API function creating a frame usable by these functions. In
Python 3.10, these functions were called directly by Python, but Python now
uses another internal function which create generators and coroutines with
no frame ("frame cleared" state). Patch by Victor Stinner.
