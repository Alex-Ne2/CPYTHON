Defining :c:macro:`Py_USING_SEMI_STABLE_API` will expose "semi-stable API",
which may change in each minor release, without deprecation warnings. The
functions :c:func:`PyEval_RequestCodeExtraIndex`, :c:func:`PyCode_GetExtra`,
:c:func:`PyCode_SetExtra`, :c:func:`PyCode_New`,
:c:func:`PyCode_NewWithPosOnlyArgs`,
:c:func:`PyInterpreterState_GetEvalFrameFunc`,
:c:func:`PyInterpreterState_SetEvalFrameFunc` and the type
:c:type:`PyFrameEvalFunction` were added to semi-stable API. Some of these
were named with a leading underscore; the old names are available as
aliases.
