Nullify inittab_copy during finalization. Before, Python interpreter finalization would leave a pointer reference to released memory. If another interpreter were initialized in the same process, it would attempt to access this memory, likely leading to a crash. This was only reproducible if Python were embedded in a larger application and does not affect any application distributed by Python itself. Patch by Gregory Szorc.
