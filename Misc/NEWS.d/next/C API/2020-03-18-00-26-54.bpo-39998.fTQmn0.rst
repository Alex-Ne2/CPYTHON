The misleading ``PyEval_AcquireLock()`` and ``PyEval_ReleaseLock()``
functions have been removed. These functions were deprecated since Python 3.2
and did not update the current thread state. Instead, use
:c:func:`PyEval_SaveThread` with :c:func:`PyEval_RestoreThread`, or
:c:func:`PyEval_AcquireThread` with :c:func:`PyEval_ReleaseThread`, which
are thread-state aware APIs.
