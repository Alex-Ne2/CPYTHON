Ensure that all of the memory needed by a type created with
:c:func:`PyType_FromSpec` or :c:func:`PyType_FromSpecWithBases` is managed by
Python. Previously, the memory referred to by ``Py_tp_methods``,
``Py_tp_getset``, ``Py_tp_members`` and the various ``char*`` fields they
contained needed to outlive the type. Now, these arrays and strings are copied
and managed by the type itself.
