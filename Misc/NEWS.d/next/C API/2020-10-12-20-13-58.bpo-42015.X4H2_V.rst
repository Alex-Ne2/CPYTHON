Order of dereferencing for `PyCFunction` deallocation changed to make sure
the object passed as ``self`` argument is only dereferenced after the last
access to the function's associated `PyMethodDef`. The allows extension
modules to manage the lifetime of dynamically allocated `PyModuleDef`
instances through ``self``.
