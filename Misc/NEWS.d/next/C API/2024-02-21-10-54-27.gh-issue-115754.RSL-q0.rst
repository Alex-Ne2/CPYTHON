In the limited C API and the stable ABI, implement ``Py_None``, ``Py_False``
``Py_True``, ``Py_Ellipsis`` and ``Py_NotImplemented`` constants are symbols,
rather than implementing them as macros. So they can be loaded by dlopen/dlsym
in an embedded in Python, rather than having to reimplement these macros
manually. In the non-limited C API, these constants are still implemented as
macros. Patch by Victor Stinner.
