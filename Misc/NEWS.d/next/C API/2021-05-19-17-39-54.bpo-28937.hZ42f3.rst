Added ``PyUnicode_SplitWithKeepempty`` and ``PyUnicode_RSplitWithKeepempty``
which act like ``PyUnicode_Split`` and ``PyUnicode_RSplit`` but provides an
additional flag ``keepempty``. This flag specifies whether empty strings are
to be retained or dropped, instead of this behaviour depending on the
whether the separator being split on is None. Patch by Mark Bell
