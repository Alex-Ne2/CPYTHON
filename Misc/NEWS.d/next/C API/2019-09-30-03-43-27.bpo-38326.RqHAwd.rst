Replaced the ``struct_size`` field in :c:type:`PyPreConfig` and
:c:type:`PyConfig` with a ``header_version`` field (accepting
``PY_VERSION_HEX``). This allows the config functions to detect all violations
of the full API/ABI compatibility expectations by embedding applications, not
just changes to the size of the configuration structures themselves.
