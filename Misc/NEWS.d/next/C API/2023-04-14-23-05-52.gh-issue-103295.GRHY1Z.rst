The PyOS_WritePerfMapEntry function has been added to write entries to a perf map file that can be used for profiling Python programs. This function can be used to write the code address, code size, and entry name for a given section of code to the perf map file. The PyOS_PerfMapState_Init function is used to initialize the perf map state and create a perf map file in /tmp, and PyOS_PerfMapState_Fini is used to clean up the state and close the file. Note that perf map is not supported on Windows.
