Add a new ``--with-relative-rpath`` configure option that sets $ORIGIN-based
RPATHs for Python binaries when enabled. This is a first step towards making
Python installations more relocatable on Linux by allowing shared libraries
to be found relative to their binary locations. Currently Linux-only.
