Update optional extension module detection for AIX
osaudiodev and spwd are not applicable for AIX
Stop saying these are missing.
3rd-party packaging of ncurses (with ASIS support) conflicts
with officially supported AIX curses library.
Configure AIX to use libcurses.a - which works -
And skip trying to build _curses_panel.
