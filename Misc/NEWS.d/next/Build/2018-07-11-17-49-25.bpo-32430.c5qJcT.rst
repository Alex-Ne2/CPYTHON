The 'configure' script no longer copies Modules/Setup.dist to Modules/Setup.
If Modules/Setup exists, it will be used in preference to Modules/Setup.dist
(this fallback logic is done by the Modules/makesetup script).  Remove the
makefile rules to re-generate Makefile and Modules/config.c if Modules/Setup
or Modules/config.c.in changes.  To re-generate, you must run "make
makesetup".  Normally that is not required since 'configure' already runs
makesetup.
