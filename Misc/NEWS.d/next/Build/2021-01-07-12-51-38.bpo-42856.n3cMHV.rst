Add ``--with-wheel-pkg-dir=PATH`` option to ./configure. If specified, the
:mod:`ensurepip` module also looks for wheel packages in this directory, and
picks the most recent versions in :mod:`ensurepip._bundled` and the
specified directory.

Some Linux distribution packaging policies recommand against bundling
dependencies. For example, Fedora installs wheel packages in the
``/usr/share/python-wheels/`` directory and don't install the
``ensurepip._bundled`` package.
