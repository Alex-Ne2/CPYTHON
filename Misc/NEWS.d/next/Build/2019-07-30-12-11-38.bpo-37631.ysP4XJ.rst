The ``$(EXTRA_CFLAGS)`` are appended to ``$(CFLAGS_NODIST)`` and not only to
``$(CFLAGS)``. This makes sure that any conflicting ``$(EXTRA_CFLAGS)`` are
used at the end of the flags chain and hence take precedence.

For example ``CFLAGS_NODIST="-O2" EXTRA_CFLAGS="-Og"`` now results in an
optimized build instead of the debug one.
