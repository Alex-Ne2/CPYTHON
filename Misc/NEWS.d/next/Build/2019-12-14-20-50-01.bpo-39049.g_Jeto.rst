Add an ability to use "elif" in for statement and while statement besides "else"

Example
We used to write like this:
```python
for i in range(j):
    ...
else:
    if i > 5:
        ...
    else:
        ...
```

Now we can write like this:
```python
for i in range(j):
    ...
elif i > 5:
    ...
else:
    ...
```

Also for "while"
This code
```python
while x:
    ...
else:
    if y:
        ...
```

Can be written this way
```python
while x:
    ...
elif y:
    ...
```
