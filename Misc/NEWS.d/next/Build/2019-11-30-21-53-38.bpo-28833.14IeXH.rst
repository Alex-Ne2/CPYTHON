Fix cross-compilation of third-party extension modules. The
``PYTHON_PROJECT_BASE`` environment variable is the path to the directory
where Python has been cross-compiled. It is used by the native python
interpreter to find the target ``sysconfigdata`` module. For example the
following command builds a wheel file to be transfered and installed with
pip on the target platform, provided the native python interpreter and the
cross-compiled one both have the wheel package installed:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ PYTHON_PROJECT_BASE=/path/to/builddir python setup.py bdist_wheel
