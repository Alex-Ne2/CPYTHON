Fix inter-mixed output when run in a multi-job build caused by the first
job overwriting the file with the first echo and all subsequent echos appending
to the end. This causes the symbol list to be defined twice leading to errant
"ld: 0711-224 WARNING: Duplicate symbol" messages from the linker.

Patch by M. Felt and Kevin (kadler).
