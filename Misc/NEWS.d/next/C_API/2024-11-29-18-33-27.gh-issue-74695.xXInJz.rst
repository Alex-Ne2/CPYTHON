Added support for `ctypes.c_bool` for structs/unions that have an endianness opposite of the current system.

Previously, on a little endian system, attempting to use a `c_bool` field in a `BigEndianStructure` would result in an exception (TypeError: This type does not support other endian: <class 'ctypes.c_bool'>). Now, it works as expected.
