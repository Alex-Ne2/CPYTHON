- Fixed a potential side effect from the global variable `_OTHER_ENDIAN` in the `_other_endian` function by ensuring itâ€™s not declared at the module level.
- Reduced redundant type checks within the `_other_endian` recursion to enhance performance during frequent calls.
- Optimized the `setattr` method in `_swapped_meta` to prevent unnecessary list creation, reducing overhead when no modifications are required.
