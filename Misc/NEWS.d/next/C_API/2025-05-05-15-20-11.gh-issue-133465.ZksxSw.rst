:c:func:`PyErr_CheckSignals` has been changed to acquire the global
interpreter lock (GIL) itself, only when necessary (i.e. when it has work to
do).  This means that modules that perform lengthy computations with the GIL
released may now call :c:func:`PyErr_CheckSignals` during those computations
without re-acquiring the GIL first.  (However, it must be *safe to* acquire
the GIL at each point where :c:func:`PyErr_CheckSignals` is called.  Also,
keep in mind that it can run arbitrary Python code before returning to you.)
