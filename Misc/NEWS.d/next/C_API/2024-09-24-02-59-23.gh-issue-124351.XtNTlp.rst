Fix potential side effect from the global variable `_OTHER_ENDIAN` in the
`_other_endian` function by ensuring it is not declared at the module level.
Reduce redundant type checks within the `_other_endian` recursion to enhance
performance during frequent calls. Optimize the `setattr` method in
`_swapped_meta` to prevent unnecessary list creation, reducing overhead when
no modifications are required.
