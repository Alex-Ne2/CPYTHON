C structures for :py:type:`str` instances, and a macro for querying a
string's memory layout, are deprecated and planned for removal in Python
3.16: :c:type:`PyASCIIObject`, :c:type:`PyCompactUnicodeObject`,
:c:type:`PyUnicodeObject`, :c:type:`PyUnicode_IS_COMPACT`. Unstable API is
added to ease migration for known use cases.
