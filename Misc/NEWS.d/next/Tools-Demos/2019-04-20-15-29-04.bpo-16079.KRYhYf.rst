Add the `duplicate_meth_defs.py` tool as a pre-commit check on Travis. The
`duplicate_meth_defs.py` tool reports duplicate method definitions in a
given list of files or directories. One must add an entry in
`Tools/scripts/duplicates_ignored.txt` to by-pass the pre-commit check when
the reported duplicate is a false positive.
