On Linux the :mod:`multiprocessing` module when configured to use the
``"forkserver"`` start method has switched back to using filesystem backed unix
domain sockets by default for communication with the fork server. No longer
using Linux's abstract socket namespace by default. Abstract sockets have no
permissions and could thus allow any user on the system in the same `network
namespace <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html>`_
(often the whole system) to inject code into the multiprocessing *forkserver*
process as a potential privilege escalation. Filesystem based socket
permissions are restricted to the forkserver user as with Python 3.8 and
earlier.

This prevents Linux `CVE-2022-42919
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42919>`_ in code that
chooses to use the *forkserver* start method as documented in
:ref:`multiprocessing contexts and start methods
<multiprocessing-start-methods>`.
