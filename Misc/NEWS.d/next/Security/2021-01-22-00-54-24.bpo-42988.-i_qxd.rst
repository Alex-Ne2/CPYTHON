Removed ``html_getfile`` function from :mod:`pydoc` since it allowed reading
an arbitrary file location.  Also added a warning to discourage users from
using :mod:`pydoc`\ 's Web server because it potentially allows other users
on the same computer to access any files accessible by the user who started the
Web server.
