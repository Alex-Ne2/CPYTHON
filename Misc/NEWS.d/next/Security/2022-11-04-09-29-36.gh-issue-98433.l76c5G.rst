The IDNA codec decoder used on DNS hostnames by :mod:`socket` or :mod:`asyncio`
related name resolution functions no longer involves a quadratic algorithm.
This prevents a potential CPU denial of service if an out-of-spec excessive
length hostname involving bidirectional characters were decoded. Some protocols
such as :mod:`urllib` http ``3xx`` redirects potentially allow for an attacker
to supply such a name.

Individual labels within an IDNA encoded DNS name will now raise an error early
during IDNA decoding if they are longer than 1000 encoded characters given that
each decoded DNS label must be 63 or fewer characters. Only an application
presenting a suspicious hostname value consisting primarily of "Nothing"
characters to be removed would run into of this new limit. See :rfc:`5894`
section 6 and :rfc:`3491`.
