Converting between :class:`int` and :class:`str` in non binary multiple bases
(2, 4, 8, 16, & 32) such as base 10 now limits the maximum number of string
digits by default to avoid potential denial of service attacks. This is a
mitigation for `CVE-2020-10735
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10735>`_.

This new limit can be configured or disabled by environment variable, command
line flag, or :mod:`sys` APIs. See the :ref:`int maximum digits limitation
<int_max_str_digits>` docs.  The default is 4300 digits.
