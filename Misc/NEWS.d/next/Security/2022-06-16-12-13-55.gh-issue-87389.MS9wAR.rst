:mod:`http.server`: Fix an open redirection vulnerability in the HTTP server
when an URI path starts with ``//``.  Vulnerability discovered, and initial
fix proposed, by Hamza Avvan.  Change `urllib.parse.urlunsplit()` to
sanitize `path` argument in order to avoid confusing the first component of
the path as a net location or scheme.
