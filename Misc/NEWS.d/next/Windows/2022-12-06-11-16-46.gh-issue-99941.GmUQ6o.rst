Made :func:`asyncio.Protocol.data_received` receive immutable object
``bytes`` instead of ``bytearrays`` with regression tests added and opted to
use ``memoryview`` to take the slices for performance on big buffers.
Performance test from ``gh-issue:21442`` done on my machine with 10
repetitions on release build with timings 0.043 (delta: 0.019) before patch
and 0.041 (delta: 0.010) after so no noticable change in performance.
