When PGO building on Windows, the folder for the instrumented binaries is
now located at the same level as that for the production builds.
(e.g. ``PCbuild/amd64/instrumented`` to ``PCbuild/amd64_instrumented``)
We need to follow ``VPATH``, which is used in new ``getpath.py`` and defined as
``"..\\.."`` in ``pythoncore.vcxproj``, to calculate the correct prefix folder.
