The python launcher, py.exe, has gained a -0 option and a -0p option. These
options _when used on their own_ will list the currently avaialbe python
versions on the host machine, with the -0p also listing the paths of each.
The current default python is indicated by an asterix on the same line.

Note that the versions are in the format accepted by py.exe and that the
stdout output when redirected to a file will only consist of these lines,
the remaining output is printed to stderr. Contributed by Steve Barnes.
