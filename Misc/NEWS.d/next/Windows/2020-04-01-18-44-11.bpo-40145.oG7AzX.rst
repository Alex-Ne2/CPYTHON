Tweaked the pcbuild options for pyshellext to reduce the size of the binary.
Since this is a very simple component, there really isn't much benefit of
optimizing for speed, likely the slowest part of this component's lifetime
is simply loading it. Total size reduction is approx 40% in release builds.
