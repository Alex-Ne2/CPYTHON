Changes to the windows launcher, (py.exe), to allow short, bit length
specific, invocation. _Previously, if you wished to launch a specific bit
length python, you had to specify both major and minor versions of python
and you could not force 64 bit_. With this change you can call py -2-32 or
py -3-32 to invoke the latest 32 bit python 2 & 3 installed on the machine
and you can now also call py -3-64 to specifically invoke 64 bit with an
error if it is not present.  You can still specify the minor version but you
don't have to. Contributed by Steve (Gadget) Barnes.
