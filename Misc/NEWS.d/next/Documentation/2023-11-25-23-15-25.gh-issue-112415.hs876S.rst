The code changes involve adding an import statement and a new decorator to the argparse.py module of the Python standard library.

The from functools import override statement at the beginning of the code adds an import for the override decorator from the functools module.

The added @override decorator applied to the __repr__() method of the _AttributeHolder class is the most significant and consequential change. This decorator indicates that the __repr__() method of this class overrides that of its superclass, whose method it is inheriting.

In summary, this commit adds the ability to override the inherited __repr__() method of a specific class in the argparse.py module, allowing for greater flexibility and customization in program behavior. The commit message indicates that these changes were uncommitted, meaning that they are just the first steps in the development process.
