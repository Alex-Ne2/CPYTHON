For Python 3.11.x and above, enable "Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 Advanced Services"
instead of "Microsoft .NET Framework Version 3.5" available for Windows 10 and above.
Also make sure "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools" are selected under
"Desktop Development with C++" in "Visual Studio installer" even if you are not
building on ARM64 along with other x64 related v143 build tools. This is because for
3.11.x and above we have upgraded to Wix-3.14.
