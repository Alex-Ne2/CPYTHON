TLSv1.3 post-handshake client authentication (PHA), often referred to as "mutual TLS" or "mTLS", allows TLS servers to authenticate client identities using digital certificates. This commit exposes a boolean property `ssl.HAS_PHA` to indicate whether the crypto library CPython is built against supports PHA, allowing python's test suite and consuming modules to branch accordingly.
