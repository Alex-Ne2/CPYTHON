Calling :meth:`argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group` on an argument group, 
and calling :meth:`argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group` or 
:meth:`argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group` on a mutually 
exclusive group have been removed. This nesting was never supported, did not 
always work correctly, and existed in the API by accident through inheritance. 
This functionality has been deprecated since Python 3.11.
