`elif` statements that follow an `else` block now have a specific error message.
```py
>>> if who == "me":
...     print("It's me!")
... else:
...     print("It's not me!")
... elif who is None:
...     print("Who is it?")
File "<stdin>", line 5
  elif who is None:
  ^^^^
SyntaxError: 'elif' block follows an 'else' block
```
