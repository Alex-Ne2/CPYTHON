Change the handling of errors raised from descriptor :meth:`__get__`
accessing some special (dunder) methods.

* Raising :class:`AttributeError` from :meth:`__get__`  will continue to treat the method *as though it was not defined*, and special methods that had a fallback will continue to fallback.
* Other errors will be propagated as-is.
* Directly affects :meth:`__eq__` (and other comparisons), :meth:`__hash__`, :meth:`__repr__`, :meth:`__iter__`.
* :meth:`__del__` will report as un-raisable.
* May affect :meth:`__contains__`, :meth:`__bool__`, :meth:`__await__`, :meth:`__aiter__`, :meth:`__anext__`.
