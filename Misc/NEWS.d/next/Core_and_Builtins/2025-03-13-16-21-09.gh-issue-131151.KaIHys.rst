Change the handling of errors raised from descriptor ``__get__``
accessing some special (dunder) methods.

* Raising ``AttributeError`` from ``__get__``  will continue to treat the method *as though it was not defined*, and special methods that had a fallback will continue to fallback.
* Other errors will be propagated as-is.
* Directly affects ``__eq__`` (and other comparisons), ``__hash__``, ``__repr__``, ``__iter__``.
* ``__del__`` will report as un-raisable.
* May affect ``__contains__``, ``__bool__``, ``__await__``, ``__aiter__``, ``__anext__``.
