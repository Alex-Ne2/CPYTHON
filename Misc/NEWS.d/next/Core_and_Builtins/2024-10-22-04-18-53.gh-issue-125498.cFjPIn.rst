The JIT has been updated to leverage LLVM 19â€™s preserve_none attribute, which
adds native support for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Calling Convention (ghccc)
for both x86-64 and AArch64 targets. This removes the need to manually patch
the calling convention in LLVM IR, simplifying the JIT compilation process.
Additionally, this update enables the optimization across all platforms, except
for i686-pc-windows-msvc where the attribute is not supported.
