The JIT has been updated to leverage LLVM 19â€™s preserve_none attribute, which natively supports the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Calling Convention (ghccc) for both x86-64 and AArch64 targets. This removes the need to manually patch the calling convention in LLVM IR, simplifying the JIT compilation process and enhancing performance. Additionally, this update enables optimizations across all platforms, except for i686-pc-windows-msvc where the attribute is not available.
