Added support for bytes and path-like objects in :func:`subprocess.Popen`
on Windows.  *args* parameter accepts now a :term:`path-like object` if
*shell* is ``False`` and a sequence containing bytes and path-like objects.
*executable* parameter accepts now a bytes and :term:`path-like object`.
*cwd* parameter accepts now a bytes object.
Based on patch by Anders Lorentsen.
