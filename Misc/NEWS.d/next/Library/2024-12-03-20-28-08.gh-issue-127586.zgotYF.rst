:class:`multiprocessing.Pool` now properly restores blocked signal handlers
of the parent thread when creating processes via either *spawn* or
*forkserver*. Previously it would unblock **SIGTERM** and **SIGINT** in the
parent thread on construction, even if either signal handler was
intentionally blocked prior to the call to construct. Additionally, child
processes can now inherit said blocked signals.
