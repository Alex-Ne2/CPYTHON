Fix :func:`shutil.copymode` on Windows. Previously it worked differenly if
*dst* is a symbolic link: it modified the permission bits of *dst* itself
rather than the file it points to if *follow_symlinks* is true or *src* is
not a symbolic link, and did not modify the permission bits if
*follow_symlinks* is false and *src* is a symbolic link.
