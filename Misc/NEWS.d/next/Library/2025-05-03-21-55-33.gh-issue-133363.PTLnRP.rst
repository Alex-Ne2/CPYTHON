The :class:`cmd.Cmd` class has been fixed to call the ``completedefault``
method whenever the ``do_shell`` method is not defined and tab completion is
requested for a line beginning with ``!``. Previously ``completedefault``
was called only if there were no spaces between the ``!`` and the cursor
position where tab completion was attempted.
