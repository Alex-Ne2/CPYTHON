Speed-up :meth:`statistics.NormalDist.samples` by using the inverse CDF method
instead of calling :func:`random.gauss`.  When an explicit ``seed=`` is
specified the original slower gauss based results remain the default to avoid
introducing behavior differences between Python versions where people expect a
consistent unchanging set of results.  Users can pass the new
``use_gauss=False`` parameter along with ``seed=`` for better performance when
using a fixed seed.
