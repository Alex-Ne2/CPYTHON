Removed the ``formatter`` module, which was deprecated in Python 3.4.
It was originally scheduled to be removed in Python 3.6,
but we decided to delay such removals until after Python 2.7 EOL.
Since Python 2.7 is the end of the life and the module did not have test codes,
it has been decided to remove the ``formatter`` module
Patch by Dong-hee Na and and Terry J. Reedy.
