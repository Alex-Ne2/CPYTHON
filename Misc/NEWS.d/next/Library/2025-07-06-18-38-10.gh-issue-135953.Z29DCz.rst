Implement a new high-frequency runtime profiler that leverages the existing
:mod:`_remote_debugging` module to collect detailed execution statistics
from running Python processes. This tool is exposed in the
:mod:`profile.sample` module and enables non-intrusive observation of
production applications by attaching to already-running processes without
requiring any code modifications, restarts, or special startup flags. The
observer can perform extremely high-frequency sampling of stack traces and
interpreter state, providing detailed runtime execution analysis of live
applications.
