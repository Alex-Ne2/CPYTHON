In :mod:`sqlite3`, fetch across rollback no longer raises
:exc:`~sqlite3.InterfaceError`. Instead, it is up to the SQLite library to
handle these cases. If SQLite is unable to carry out the operation,
:exc:`~sqlite3.OperationalError` will be raised with an appropriate error
message. If SQLite is able to carry out the operation, no exception is
raised. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
