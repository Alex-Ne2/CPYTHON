Python Counter Class Enhanced to Fix TypeError for Custom Objects
The Python Counter class has been improved to handle custom objects without causing TypeError. The previous version had issues when adding counts for non-integer objects, like datetime.timedelta, during the update operation. This update ensures the smooth addition and initialisation of such elements.

Key Improvement:
The update method now checks if an element exists in the counter. If it does, it adds the count to the existing value; if not, it initialises the count. This prevents the TypeError and supports more data types.


Benefits:
Handles Custom Objects: Supports various data types without errors.
Smooth Operations: Ensures proper addition and initialization of elements.
Versatility: Extends the utility of the Counter class for complex tasks.
This update makes the Counter class more robust and versatile, enhancing its usability for developers working with diverse data types in Python.
