:func:`shutil.copyfile`, :func:`shutil.copy`, :func:`shutil.copy2`,
:func:`shutil.copytree` and :func:`shutil.move` use platform specific zero-
copy syscalls on Linux, OSX and Windows in order to copy the file more
efficiently. The speedup for copying a 512MB file is about +26% on Linux,
+50% on OSX and +48% on Windows. (Contributed by Giampaolo Rodola' in
