:func:`shutil.copyfile`, :func:`shutil.copy`, :func:`shutil.copy2`,
:func:`shutil.copytree` and :func:`shutil.move` use platform-specific
fast-copy syscalls on Linux, Solaris and macOS in order to copy the file
more efficiently.
Also, :func:`shutil.copyfile` default buffer size on Windows was increased
from 16KiB to 1MiB. The speedup for copying a 512MiB file is about +26% on
Linux, +50% on macOS and +40% on Windows. Also, much less CPU cycles are
consumed (Contributed by Giampaolo Rodola' in :issue:`25427`.)
