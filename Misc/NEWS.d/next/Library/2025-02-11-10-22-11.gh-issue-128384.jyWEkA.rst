Make :class:`warnings.catch_warnings` use a context variable for holding
the warning filtering state if the :data:`sys.flags.thread_safe_warnings`
flag is set to true.  This makes using the context manager thread-safe in
multi-threaded programs.  The flag is true by default in free-threaded builds
and is otherwise false.  The value of the flag can be overridden by the
the :option:`-X thread_safe_warnings <-X>` command-line option or by the
:envvar:`PYTHON_THREAD_SAFE_WARNINGS` environment variable.
