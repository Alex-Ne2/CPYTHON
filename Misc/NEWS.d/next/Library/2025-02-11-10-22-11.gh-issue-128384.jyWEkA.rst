Make :class:`warnings.catch_warnings` use a context variable for holding the
warning filtering state if the :data:`sys.flags.inherit_context` flag is set
to true.  This makes using the context manager thread-safe in multi-threaded
programs.  The flag is true by default in free-threaded builds and is
otherwise false.  The default value of the flag can be overridden by the the
:option:`-X inherit_context <-X>` command-line option or by the
:envvar:`PYTHON_INHERIT_CONTEXT` environment variable.
