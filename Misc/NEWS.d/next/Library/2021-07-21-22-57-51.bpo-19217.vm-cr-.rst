Optimize :meth:`~unittest.TestCase.assertEqual` for long sequences of varied
items. Based on an internal heuristic, the algorithm used to produce the diff
method will switch based on the relevant magnitude of inputs. As a result, diff
output after a failing assertion may appear differently for large inputs.
Specifically, unittest will internally switch from using :func:`difflib.ndiff`
(slow) to using :func:`difflib.unified_diff` (fast).

This optimization ensures that the non-linear time complexity of
:func:`difflib.ndiff` does not cause a test suite to hang.
