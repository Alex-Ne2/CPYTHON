Fix a race condition in asyncio MultiLoopChildWatcher: call the loop
add_signal_handler() rather than calling directly signal.signal(), so
signal.set_wakeup_fd() is used to wake up the event loop when the SIGCHLD
signal is received. Previously, the event loop could block forever if the
signal was received while the loop was idle. The signal was only proceed
when another event woke up the event loop. Patch by Victor Stinner.
