The picklers do no longer allocate temporary memory when dumping large
``bytes`` and ``str`` objects into a file object. Instead the data is
directly streamed into the underlying file object.

Previously the C implementation would buffer all content and issue a
single call to ``file.write`` at the end of the dump. With protocol 4
this behavior has changed to issue one call to ``file.write`` per frame.
