Partial support for ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` environment variable for sdists
has been added in distutils. When the ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` environment
variable is set, the ``mtime`` of the files in an sdist tar archive will not
be later than ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH``. This is a firs step to simplify getting
byte identical reproducibility of source dists.
