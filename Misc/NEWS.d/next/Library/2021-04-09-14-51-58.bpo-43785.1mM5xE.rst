Improve ``bz2.BZ2File`` performance. Remove `RLock` from `BZ2File`. It makes
`BZ2File` to thread unsafe, but gzip and lzma don't use it too. Add
``BZ2File.__iter__()`` method which delegate to internal buffer's
``__iter__`` method. It is much faster than calling ``BZ2File.readline()``
for each lines. Patch by Inada Naoki.
