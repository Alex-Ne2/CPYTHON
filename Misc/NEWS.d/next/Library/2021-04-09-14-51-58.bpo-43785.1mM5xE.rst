Improve ``bz2.BZ2File`` performance by removing the RLock from BZ2File.
This makes BZ2File thread unsafe in the face of multiple simultaneous
readers or writers, just like its equivalent classes in :mod:`gzip` and
:mod:`lzma` have always been.  Adds a ``BZ2File.__iter__()`` method to
delegate to the internal buffer's ``__iter__`` method.  It is much faster
than calling ``BZ2File.readline()`` for each lines.  Patch by Inada Naoki.
