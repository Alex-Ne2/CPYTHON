Simplified AST for subscription. Simple indices will be represented by their
value, extended slices will be represented as tuples.  :mod:`ast` classes
``Index`` and ``ExtSlice`` are considered deprecated and will be removed in
future Python versions. In meanwhile, ``Index(value)`` will return a ``value``
itself, ``ExtSlice(slices)`` will return ``Tuple(slices, Load())``.
