multiprocessing: Fix a handle leak when a pool worker is terminated quickly.

When using a pool of processes on Windows, if the worker is terminated
quickly, handles created by DupHandle() on reduction.dump() can remain open
in the parent process, causing a handles leak.

Use a different strategy in the case: keep the handle open in the parent
process for the lifetime of the worker, and the parent becomes responsible
to close the handle when the worker completes.
