Raise ValueError if an email header name includes linefeed or carriage
return characters. Allow email header values to include linefeed and
carriage return characters following a non-space character, appending
space characters to indicate header value continuation. Other occurrences
of linefeed and carriage return characters in header values raise
ValueError.
