Add locking to :mod:`warnings` to avoid some data races when free-threading
is used.  Change ``_warnings_runtime_state.mutex`` to be a recursive mutex
and expose it to :mod:`warnings`, via the :func:`_acquire_lock` and
:func:`_release_lock` functions.  Hold the lock when ``filters`` and
``_filters_version`` are updated.
