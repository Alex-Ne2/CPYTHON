Added :class:`asyncio.ThreadPool`, an asynchronous context manager for
concurrently running IO-bound functions without blocking the event loop.
It essentially works as a higher-level version of
:meth:`asyncio.loop.run_in_executor` that can take keyword arguments and
be used as a context manager using ``async with``.
