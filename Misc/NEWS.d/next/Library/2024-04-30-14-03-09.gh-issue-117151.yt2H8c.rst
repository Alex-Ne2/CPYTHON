Increase ``io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`` from 8k to 128k and adjust :func:`open` on
platforms where :meth:`os.fstat` provides a ``st_blksize`` field (such as Linux)
to use ``max(min(io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, 8 MiB), device block size)`` rather
than always using the device block size. This should improve I/O performance.
