The undocumented function ``inspect.getargs`` is deprecated in
Python 3.13 and slated for removal in Python 3.15.
:func:`inspect.signature` is the most accurate way to obtain the signature
of a callable. If you only have access to a code object, however,
``inspect.signature(types.FunctionType(co, {}))`` can be used as a
direct replacement for ``inspect.getargs()``.
