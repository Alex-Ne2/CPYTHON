Fixed incorrect discrimination between string and list types in
distutils.CCompiler.set_executables() method. Previously if unicode string
was passed as executable value it was considered not as string, but as list.
It caused TypeError: "coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, list
found" at unixccompiler.py, line 122, in _compile().
