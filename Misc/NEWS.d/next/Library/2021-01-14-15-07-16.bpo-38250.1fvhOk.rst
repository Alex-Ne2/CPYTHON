[Enum] Flags consisting of a single bit are now considered canonical, and
will be the only flags returned from listing and iterating over a Flag class
or a Flag member.  Multi-bit flags are considered aliases; they will be
returned from lookups and operations that result in their value.

For example:

>>> class Color(Flag):     ...     BLACK = 0     ...     RED = 1     ...
GREEN = 2     ...     BLUE = 4     ...     WHITE = 7     ...     >>>
list(Color)     [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.GREEN: 2>, <Color.BLUE: 4>]     >>>
Color(7)     <Color.WHITE: 7>     >>> Color.RED | Color.GREEN | Color.BLUE
<Color.WHITE: 7>     >>> Color.RED & Color.GREEN     <Color.BLACK: 0>
