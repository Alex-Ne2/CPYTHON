Define a *venv* :ref:`sysconfig installation scheme <installation_paths>`
to be used for bootstrapping new virtual environments. It is a copy of the
*posix_prefix* or *nt* install scheme depending on the platform. The
:mod:`venv` module now uses that scheme to create new virtual environments
instead of hardcoding the paths depending only on the platform. Downstream
Python distributors customizing the *posix_prefix* or *nt* install
scheme in a way that is not compatible with the install scheme used in
virtual environments are encouraged to do it after the *venv* scheme
is created or to supply a modified working *venv* scheme.
When Python itself runs in a virtual environment,
:func:`sysconfig.get_default_scheme` and
:func:`sysconfig.get_preferred_scheme` with ``key="prefix"`` returns *venv*.
