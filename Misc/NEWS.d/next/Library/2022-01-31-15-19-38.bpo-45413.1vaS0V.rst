Define a ``"venv"`` :mod:`sysconfig` installation scheme to be used for
bootstrapping new virtual environments. It is a copy of the
``"posix_prefix"`` or ``"nt"`` install scheme depending on the platform. The
:mod:`venv` module now uses that scheme to create new virtual environments
instead of hardcoding the paths depending only on the platform. Downstream
Python distributors customizing the ``"posix_prefix"`` or ``"nt"`` install
scheme in a way that is not compatible with the install scheme used in
virtual environments are encouraged to do it after the ``"venv"`` scheme
is created or to supply a modified working ``"venv"`` scheme.
When Python itself runs in a virtual environment,
:func:`sysconfig.get_default_scheme` returns ``"venv"``.
