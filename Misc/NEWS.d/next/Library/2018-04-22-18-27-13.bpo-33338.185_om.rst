lib2to3's tokenizer was synchronized with the built-in tokenizer, providing
many wins, including:

- the ``tokenize.tokenize()`` API is now mimicked in ``lib2to3``, including
automatic encoding detection and yielding ENCODING tokens; - Unicode
identifiers are now supported; - ELLIPSIS is its own token type now; -
Untokenizer improved with backports of 5e6db31, 9dc3a36, 5b8d2c3, e411b66,
and BPO-2495.
