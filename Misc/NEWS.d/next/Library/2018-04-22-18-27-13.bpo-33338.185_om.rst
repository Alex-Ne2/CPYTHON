lib2to3's tokenizer was synchronized with the built-in tokenizer.  This
provides multiple wins.  The ``tokenize.tokenize()`` API is now mimicked
in ``lib2to3``, including automatic encoding detection and yielding of
the ENCODING token.  Unicode identifiers are now supported.  ELLIPSIS is
its own token type now.  Untokenizer improved with backports of 5e6db31,
9dc3a36, 5b8d2c3, e411b66, and BPO-2495.
