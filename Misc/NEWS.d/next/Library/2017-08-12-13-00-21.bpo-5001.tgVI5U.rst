This is a fix of some of the uninformative asserts in `multiprocessing`,
including in `multiprocessing.managers` and `multiprocessing.queues`. Those
in the queues.py module remain AssertionErrors, as do some in the
managers.py module; others have been changed to more specific errors. In
BaseManager's interpretation of method_to_typeid entries, checking for
type(key or value) == str has been replaced with isinstance(key or value,
str). - Patch by Allen W. Smith (drallensmith on GitHub).
