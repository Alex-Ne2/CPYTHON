posix.getgrouplist() fails when when the user has NGROUPS_MAX supplemental GIDs. This becomes a problem on OS X Mojave (14.x) because the system defines NGROUPS_MAX to be 16 and it is common for a user to belong to 16 groups. The fix is to increase the size of the array passed to the underlying getgrouplist() POSIX API function to allow space for the user's primary group, which is not accounted for in the NGROUPS_MAX constant (per POSIX.1).
