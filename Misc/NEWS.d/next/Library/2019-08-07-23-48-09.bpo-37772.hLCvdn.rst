The zipfile.Path.iterdir() method calls a static method _add_implied_dirs. This was either returning duplicate directory names or missing directories. The fix was to use a set to collect unique directories using posixpath.dirname and then taking a second pass on collected set and use pathlib.PurePath on each directory and collect the parents and add that to our set and finally return all as a list.
