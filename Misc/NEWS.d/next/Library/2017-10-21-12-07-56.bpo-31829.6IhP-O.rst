Resolved some portability issues with pickle.

* Documented that files should be open in binary mode even for protocol 0 for
  portability.
* ValueError now is raised when pickle with binary protocol to a file opened
  in text mode on Windows.
* Deprecation warning is emitted when pickle with binary protocol to a file
  opened in text mode on Unix.
* Deprecation warning is emitted in Py3k mode when pickle with protocol 0 to
  a file opened in text mode.
* Fixed unpickling on Unix or in binary mode files writen in text mode on
  Windows.  RuntimeWarning now is emitted in cases that was not unpickleable
  before.  Files containing Unicode strings will be unpickled incorrectly.
* ``\r``, ``\0`` and ``\x1a`` (end-of-file on Windows) now are escaped in
  Unicode strings in protocol 0.
