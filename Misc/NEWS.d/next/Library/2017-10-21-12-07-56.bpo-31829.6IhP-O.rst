Text (protocol 0) pickles dumped to files opened in binary mode can now be
loaded from files opened in text mode without loss.  Dumping binary pickle to
a file opened in text mode on Windows will now produce a :exc:`ValueError`,
since it leads to data corruption.  Dumping binary pickle on other systems and
text pickle on all systems in Py3k mode to a file opened in text mode will now
produce a :exc:`DeprecationWarning`.
