Resolved some portability issues with pickle.  Documented that files should
be open in binary mode even for protocol 0 for portability.  ValueError is
now raised when pickle with binary protocol to a file opened in text mode on
Windows.  Deprecation warning is emitted when pickle with binary protocol to
a file opened in text mode on Unix.  Deprecation warning is emitted in Py3k
mode when pickle with protocol 0 to a file opened in text mode. ``\r``,
`\0`` and ``\x1a`` (end-of-file on Windows) are now escaped in Unicode strings
in protocol 0.
