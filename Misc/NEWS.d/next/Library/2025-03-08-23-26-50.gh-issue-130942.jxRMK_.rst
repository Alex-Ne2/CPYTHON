.. versionchanged:: next
    :func:`glob.translate` now correctly handles ranges implicitly containing path
    separators (for instance, ``[%-0]`` contains ``/``) by adding either a negative
    lookahead (``(?!/)``) or by not including the path separator (``^/``). In addition,
    ranges including path separator literals are now correctly escaped, as specified by
    POSIX specifications.

.. versionchanged:: next
    :func:`fnmatch.translate` does not treat path separator characters as having any
    special meaning at all, so it still matches ranges implicitly containing path
    separators (for instance, ``[%-0]`` contains ``/``) and ranges explicitly
    containing path separators (for instance, ``[/-/]`` contains ``/``).
