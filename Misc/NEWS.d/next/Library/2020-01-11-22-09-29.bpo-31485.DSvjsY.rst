On the tkinter library, the widget.unbind(<Sequence>, funcid) call unbinds all bindings for <Sequence>, while documentation states that when funcid is given all other bindings remains untuched. Apparently this behaviour is not offered by tkinter itself and, in case of non-empty funcid argument value be given, should be obtained by, at first, unbinding all bindings and then bind again all the ones not having the given funcid. This is basically what the proposed patch does. It takes account of the modifications done into the unbind method docstring, as described by other PSF members on the issue tracker.
