Remove :meth:`!__reduce__` and :meth:`!__reduce_ex__` methods that always
raise :exc:`TypeError` in the C implementation of :class:`io.FileIO`,
:class:`io.BufferedReader`, :class:`io.BufferedWriter` and
:class:`io.BufferedRandom` and replace them with :meth:`!__getstatus__`
methods that always raise :exc:`!TypeError`. This restores fine details of
behavior of Python 3.11 and older versions.
