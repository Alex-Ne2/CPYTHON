Allow defining ``GenericAlias``-like things.
This lets libraries that want to do custom runtime handling of generic
parameters and their substitutions integrate with the rest of typing, for
example with :func:`typing.get_args`, :func:`typing.get_origin`, and as
parameters to other generics like :class:`list`, :class:`dict` and so on.
