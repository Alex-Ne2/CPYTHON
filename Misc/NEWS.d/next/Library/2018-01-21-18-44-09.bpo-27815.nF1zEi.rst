SSL

The *suppress_ragged_eofs* setting is now disabled by default. This means
that by default a TCP shutdown, which may not be secure, raises
:exc:`~ssl.SSLEOFError`, and applications can distinguish a secure SSL
shutdown from a truncation attack.  There is a new
:attr:`SSLContext.suppress_ragged_eofs
<ssl.SSLContext.suppress_ragged_eofs>` attribute, which can be used to re-
enable the setting via a context object.
