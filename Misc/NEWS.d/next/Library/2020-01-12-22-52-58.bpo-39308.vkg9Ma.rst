Add `_TypedSpecialForm` to support declaring types, like `typing.Literal`, that are
type sensitive. Also added `_typed_tp_cache` decorator to support `_TypedSpecialForm` types.
Patch also fixes a case for `typing.Literal` when latter is created with values being
subclass to each other i.e. `int` and `bool`. Patch by Tomasz TrÄ™bski.
