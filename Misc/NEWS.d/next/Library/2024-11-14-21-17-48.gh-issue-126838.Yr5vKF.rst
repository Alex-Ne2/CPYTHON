Fix issue where :func:`urllib.request.url2pathname` mishandled file URLs with
authorities. If an authority matches the current hostname it is now discarded.
Otherwise, if the new *resolve_netloc* keyword-only argument is set to true,
the authority is resolved and discarded if it matches a local IP address. If
the authority is still unhandled, then then on Windows a UNC path is returned
(as before), and on other platforms a :exc:`urllib.error.URLError` is now raised.
