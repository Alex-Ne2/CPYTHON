Fix issue where :func:`urllib.request.url2pathname` mishandled file URLs with
non-empty, non-``localhost`` authorities on non-Windows systems. Authorities
that resolve to ``localhost`` are now discarded; other authorities now cause
a :exc:`urllib.error.URLError` to be raised. Previously these authorities
were incorrectly included in the returned path. This change does not affect
Windows, where UNC paths are returned for non-local URLs.
