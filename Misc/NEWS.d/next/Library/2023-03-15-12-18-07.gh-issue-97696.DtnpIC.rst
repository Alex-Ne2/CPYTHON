Implemented an eager task factory in asyncio.
When used as a task factory on an event loop, it performs eager execution of
coroutines. coroutines that are able to complete synchronously (e.g. return or
raise without blocking) are returned immediately as a finished task, and the
task is never scheduled to the event loop. If the coroutine blocks, the
(pending) is scheduled and returned.
