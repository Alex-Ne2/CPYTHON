Issue: :gh:`130902`


Modified close(self) method of HTTPConnection class to include an optional socket shutdown similar to gh-130850. Includes error handling. As mentioned, it adds an optional shutdown param to the close method, keeping existing programs working, but adding an extra feature to new programs that offers improvements.
