:class:`unittest.mock.Mock` instances can no longer be used as the specs for
other :class:`unittest.mock.Mock` objects. This constraint is enforced across
all Mock variants such as :class:`unittest.mock.MagicMock` and may uncover bugs
in existing tests. Notably, Mock specs cause assert functions like
:meth:`unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_once_with()` to themselves be mocked
out and unconditionally pass.

This issue is most often encountered when failing to stop and restart a patch
using ``autospec=True`` across test cases, when using an already-mocked object
as the input to :meth:`unittest.mock.create_autospec()`, or when attempted to
mock an attribute of an existing :class:`unittest.mock.Mock` using
``autospec=True``.
