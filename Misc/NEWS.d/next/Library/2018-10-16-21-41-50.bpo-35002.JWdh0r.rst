In python3.6, before os.Pathlike was introduced.
configparser.ConfigParser.read() throws an error when a single `PosixPath`
object was passed, however a list of `PosixPath` is allowed. I have added an
additional condition in ConfigParser.read() so that passing a single
`PosixPath` will not throw an error
