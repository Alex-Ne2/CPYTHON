ISO8601 Format recommends "a decimal fraction may be added to the lowest order time element present." 
Thus "T0314.15" should be valid and yield "03:14:09", but currently yields "03:14:00.150000". This has been corrected, with the addition of handling cases of "T03.50" as "03:30", "T0320.25" as "03:20:15" and "T032010.15" as "03:20:10.15".
