When headers are added to :meth:`email.message.Message` objects, either through
:meth:`email.message.Message.__setitem__` or :meth:`email.message.Message.add_header`,
the field name is now validated according to  :rfc:`RFC 5322, Section 3.6.8 <5322#section-3.6.8>`
and a :exc:`ValueError` is raised if the field name contains any invalid characters.
