Prevent the ProcessPoolExecutor executor thread, which remains running when shutdown is called with wait=False, from attempting to adjust the pool's worker processes after the object state has already been reset during shutdown. A combination of conditions, including a worker process having terminated abormally, resulted in an exception and a potential hang when the still-running executor thread attempted to replace dead workers within the pool.
