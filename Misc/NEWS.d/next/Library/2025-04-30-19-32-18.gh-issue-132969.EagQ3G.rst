Prevent the `ProcessPoolExecutor` executor thread from tying to adjust worker processes after `shutdown` is called and object state has already been reset. Calling `shutdown` with `wait=False` resets the state of the `ProcessPoolExecutor` while still leaving the executor thread running. A combination of conditions including a worker process having terminated abormally and `shutdown(wait=False)` resulted in an exception when the executor thread tried to replace dead workers, and additionally the process could also potentially hang.
