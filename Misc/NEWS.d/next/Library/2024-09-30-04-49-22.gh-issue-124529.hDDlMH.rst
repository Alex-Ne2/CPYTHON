Fix :meth:`datetime.datetime.strptime`, :meth:`datetime.date.strptime` as
well as :func:`time.strptime` (by modifying :class:`_strptime.TimeRE`) to
make ``%c`` and ``%x`` accept year number representations consisting of
fewer digits than the usual four or two (note that nothing changes for
``%Y`` and ``%y``). Thanks to that, certain ``strftime/strptime`` round
trips (such as ``datetime.strptime(dt.strftime("%c"), "%c"))`` for
``dt.year`` less than 1000) no longer raise ``ValueError`` for some
locales/platforms (this was the case, e.g., on Linux -- for various
locales, including ``C``/``C.UTF-8``).
