Fix a race condition in ``MultiLoopChildWatcher``. The patch does the
following -

1) Creates a list that will keep track of the event loops where the handler
has been installed by ``MultiLoopChildWatcher``.

2) In ``attach_loop`` and ``add_child_handler``, the handler is installed for the
loop using ``add_signal_handler`` and the event loop instance is also added to
the list.

3) In ``remove_child_handler``, the ``remove_signal_handler`` is called on the
loop the provided pid is attached to.

4) In ``close``, the ``remove_signal_handler`` is called on every loop and the
loop is removed from the list.

The patch changes the behavior of ``MultiLoopChildWatcher``. ``MultiLoopChildWatcher``
can now only be used in the main thread.
