We've exposed the low-level ``_interpreters`` module for the sake of the
PyPI implementation of PEP 734.  It was sometimes available as the
``_xxsubinterpreters`` module and was formerly used only for testing. For
the most part, it should be considered an internal module, like ``_thread``
and ``_imp``. See
https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-734-multiple-interpreters-in-the-stdlib/41147/26.
