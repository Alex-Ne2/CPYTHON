Title: Fix ``_eval_type`` Handling for ``GenericAlias`` with Unflattened Arguments and ``Union`` Types
Issue: :gh:`130870`

Detailed changes:
This change improves the handling of ``GenericAlias`` and ``Union`` types in ``_eval_type``, ensuring that callable arguments for ``GenericAlias`` are unflattened and that ``Union`` types are properly evaluated. It resolves complex annotations, including recursive and generic types. All relevant tests, including those for forward references, generics, ``Union`` types, and recursion, passed successfully without any issues.
