Improve pathlib.Path compatibility on zipfile.Path and correct performance degradation as found in zipp 3.0. This backward-incompatible change alters the default behavior for ``zipfile.Path.open`` to match the open behavior on ``pathlib.Path``. For compatibility across Python 3.8.0-3.8.2 and later versions, consider using ``zipp.Path`` on Python 3.8.2 and earlier. For a quick compatibility workaround, ``zipfile.Path.root.open`` provides the same interface as ``zipfile.Path.open`` on Python 3.8.2.
