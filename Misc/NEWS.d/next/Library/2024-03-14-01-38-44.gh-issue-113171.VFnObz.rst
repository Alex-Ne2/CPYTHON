Fixed various false positives and false negatives in

* :attr:`ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global`
* :attr:`ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private`
* :attr:`ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_global`
* :attr:`ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_private`

An the corresponding :class:`ipaddress.IPv4Network` and :class:`ipaddress.IPv6Network`
attributes.

The new behavior:

* ``192.0.0.0/24`` is considered private with the exception of ``192.0.0.9/32`` and
  ``192.0.0.10/32`` (previously: only the ``192.0.0.0/29`` sub-range was considered private).
* ``64:ff9b:1::/48`` is considered private.
* ``2002::/16`` is considered private.
* There are exceptions within ``2001::/23`` (otherwise considered private): ``2001:1::1/128``,
  ``2001:1::2/128``, ``2001:3::/32``, ``2001:4:112::/48``, ``2001:20::/28``, ``2001:30::/28``.
  The exceptions are not considered private.
* The shared address space (``100.64.0.0/10``) is not treated in any special way anymore,
  previously it was considered both not private and not global. It is considered private now.
