Make :mod:`heapq` max-heap functions

* :func:`heapq.heapify_max`,
* :func:`heapq.heappush_max`,
* :func:`heapq.heappop_max`,
* :func:`heapq.heapreplace_max`

public. And add the missing :func:`heapq.heappushpop_max` to
both the C and Python implementation.

Previous underscored naming is kept for backwards compatibility.
