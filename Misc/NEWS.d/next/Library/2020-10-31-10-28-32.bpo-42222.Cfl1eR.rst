Harmonized random.randrange() argument handling to better match
that used by range().

* The integer test/conversion in randrange() now uses operator.index().
* Float arguments to randrange() is deprecated.
* The *ValueError* is deprecated in favor of a *TypeError*.
* It now runs a little faster than before.
