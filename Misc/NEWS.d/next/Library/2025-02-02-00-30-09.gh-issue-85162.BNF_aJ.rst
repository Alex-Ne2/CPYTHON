The :mod:`http.server` module now includes built-in support for HTTPS
server. New :class:`http.server.HTTPSServer` class is an implementation of
HTTPS server that uses :mod:`ssl` module by providing a certificate and
private key. The ``--tls-cert``, ``--tls-key`` and ``--tls-password``
arguments have been added to ``python -m http.server``. Patch by Semyon
Moroz.
