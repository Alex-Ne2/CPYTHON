Transformation performed by certain fixers (e.g. future, itertools_imports) that causes a statement to be replaced by a blank line will generate a Python file that contains syntax error. Enhancement applied checks whether the statement to be replaced has any siblings or not. If no sibling is found, then the statement gets replaced with a "pass" statement instead of a blank line.
By doing this, Python source files generated by 2to3 are more readily runnable right after the transformation.
