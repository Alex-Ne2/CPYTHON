The :mod:`email` module no longer incorrectly encodes non-ASCII characters
in email addresses using :rfc:`2047` encoding. Under a policy with ``utf8=True``
this means the addresses will be correctly passed through. Under a policy with
``utf8=False``, attempting to serialize a message with non-ASCII email addresses
will now result in an :exc:`~email.errors.InvalidMailboxError`.
