Frozen dataclasses, in conjunction with with __slots__, cannot be unpickled,
as we were using `__setattr__` to set the new instance's attribute which
conflicts with the __slots__ definition. Adding `__getstate__` and
`__setstate__` for these classes should alleviate the issue, as we can use
`object.__setattr__` instead to set the frozen attributes on instance's
state assignment.
