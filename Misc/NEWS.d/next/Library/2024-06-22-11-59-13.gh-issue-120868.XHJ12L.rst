Fix a bug in :mod:`logging.config` that would eagerly create an instance of
:class:`multiprocessing.Manager` when configuring a queue_listener with
:class:`logging.handlers.QueueHandler`. This could cause issue in environments where
``multiprocessing.Manager`` does not work. The new implementation will only check for
these types when it has been verified that ``multiprocessing.Manager`` has been used to
create the ``queue`` in the logging configuration in question.
