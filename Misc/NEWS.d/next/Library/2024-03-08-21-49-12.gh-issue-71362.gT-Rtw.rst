:class:`pathlib.PosixPath` and :class:`~pathlib.WindowsPath` objects are now
pickled as :class:`~pathlib.Path` objects, which allows them to be unpickled
on any operating system. Care should be taken as paths may be interpreted
differently; for example, ``"c:/"`` is an absolute path on Windows but not
POSIX.
