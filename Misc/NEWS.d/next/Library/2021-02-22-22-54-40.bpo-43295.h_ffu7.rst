Previously, datetime.strptime would match 'z' with the format string '%z'
(for UTC offsets), throwing an IndexError by erroneously trying to parse 'z'
as a timestamp. As a special case, '%z' matches the string 'Z' which is
equivalent to the offset '+00:00', however this behavior is not defined for
lowercase 'z'. This change ensures a ValueError is thrown when encountering
the original example, as follows:

>>> from datetime import datetime >>> datetime.strptime('z', '%z')
ValueError: time data 'z' does not match format '%z'
