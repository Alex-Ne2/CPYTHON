The :mod:`multiprocessing` module now triggers a :exc:`DeprecationWarning`
when the (``fork``) start method is used implicitly via the default behavior
on non-macOS POSIX-like platforms.

We want application authors to explicitly specify their start method (thus
avoiding the warning) when they do need to use ``fork``. Our default will
change to something more conservative and compatible with multithreaded
processes in the Python 3.14 timeframe.

macOS and Windows already default to the ``spawn`` start method.
