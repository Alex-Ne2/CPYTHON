Propose Feature: Support for :func:`set` in :class:`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager`

I propose adding support for the :func:`set` function in the :class:`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager`.
`SetProxy`, which inherits from `BaseProxy`, has been added.
`SetProxy` supports all functions that the primitive type :func:`set` provides.
