Fix issue where :func:`os.path.realpath` didn't raise :exc:`OSError` when
given a non-directory path with a trailing slash in *strict* mode on POSIX.
:func:`~os.path.realpath` now raises :exc:`NotADirectoryError` in this case,
and whenever a non-directory path in a non-final position is resolved; for
example, ``realpath("photo.jpg/spam", strict=True)`` now raises
:exc:`NotADirectoryError` for ``"photo.jpg"`` rather than
:exc:`FileNotFoundError` for ``"photo.jpg/spam"``.
