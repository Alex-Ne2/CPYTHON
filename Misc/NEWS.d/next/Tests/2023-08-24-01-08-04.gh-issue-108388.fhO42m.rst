The slowest tests are now skipped by default, unless the "cpu" resource is
enabled: test_concurrent_futures, test_multiprocessing_spawn,
test_peg_generator and test_tools.test_freeze. Run the test suite with ``-u
cpu`` or ``-u all`` to run these tests. Moreover, these tests are no longer
skipped on Python built with ASAN or MSAN sanitizer. Patch by Victor
Stinner.
