Fix a race condition in ``multiprocessing.semaphore_tracker`` when the
tracker receives SIGINT before it can register signal handlers for ignoring
it. Improve ``_test_multiprocessing.test_semaphore_tracker_sigint`` and
related tests to fail when the tracker dies when delivering signals ignored
by it.
