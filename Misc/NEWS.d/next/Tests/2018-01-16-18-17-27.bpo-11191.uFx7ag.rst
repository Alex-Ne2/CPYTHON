skip the distutils test 'test_search_cpp' when AIX and not gcc as compiler
    as xlc et al do not support -o (as output). 'cpp' output is ALWAYS to stdout
also add additional logic Lib/test/__init__.py for when
    sysconfig.customize_compiler returns [] rather than None
add the additional argument '-C' for AIX xlc cpp processing so comments are
    included in the cpp output rather than replaced by a single ' ' (space) char.
