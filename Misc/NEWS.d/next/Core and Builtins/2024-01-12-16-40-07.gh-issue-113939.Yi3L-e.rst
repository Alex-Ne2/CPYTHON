frame.clear():
Clear frame.f_locals as well, and not only the fast locals.
This is relevant once frame.f_locals was accessed,
which would contain also references to all the locals.

Opcode DELETE_FAST:
Also clear frame.f_locals, and not only the fast local.
If frame.f_locals was accessed of the current frame,
e.g. like exception handling code might do,
frame.f_locals still holds references to the locals,
even though you would expect that they are freed.
