Cases of sorting using tuples as keys may be significantly faster
in some cases. This is worth mentioning because, if the tuple
elements don't define a total ordering, the order of the result
may differ from earlier releases. It's generally true that the
result of sorting simply isn't well-defined in the absence of a
total ordering on list elements.
