The opargs for cell-related opcodes were out of sync with the fast locals,
leading to unnecessary runtime costs and extra complexity in the code. Now
much of the work has been moved to the compiler.  This includes the addition
of the ``MAKE_CELL`` opcode.  Additionally, when an arg "escapes" the
function (in the closure to an inner function) the cell is stored at the
same index as the arg now, whereas before one of the slots was wasted.
