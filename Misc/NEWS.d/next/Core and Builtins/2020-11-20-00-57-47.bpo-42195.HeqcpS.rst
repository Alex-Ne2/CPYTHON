The ``__args__`` of the parameterized generics for :data:`typing.Callable`
and :class:`collections.abc.Callable` are now consistent.  The ``__args__`` 
for :class:`collections.abc.Callable` are now flattened while 
:data:`typing.Callable`'s have not changed.  To allow this change, 
:class:`types.GenericAlias` can now be subclassed.  Patch by Ken Jin.
