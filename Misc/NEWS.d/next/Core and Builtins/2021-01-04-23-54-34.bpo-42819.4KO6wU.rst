Explicitly disable bracketed paste in the interactive interpreter, even if it's
set in the inputrc or is enabled by default (eg GNU Readline 8.1). The Python
REPL has not implemented bracketed paste support so this prevents Readline
defaults or global user configuration from causing unexpected behavior within
Python. It can still be explicitly enabled by calling
``readline.parse_and_bind("set enable-bracketed-paste on")``. Patch by Dustin
Rodrigues.
