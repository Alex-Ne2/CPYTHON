Added the methods ``PyObject_Vectorcall``, ``PyObject_VectorcallDict`` and
``PyObject_VectorcallMethod`` to the limited API along with the auxiliary
macro constant ``PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET``.

The availability of these functions enables more efficient PEP-590 vector
calls from binary extension modules that avoid argument boxing/unboxing
overheads.
