Added the methods :c:func:`PyObject_Vectorcall`,
:c:func:`PyObject_VectorcallDict` and :c:func:`PyObject_VectorcallMethod` to
the limited API along with the auxiliary macro constant
:c:macro:`PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET`.

The availability of these functions enables more efficient :PEP:`590` vector
calls from binary extension modules that avoid argument boxing/unboxing
overheads.
