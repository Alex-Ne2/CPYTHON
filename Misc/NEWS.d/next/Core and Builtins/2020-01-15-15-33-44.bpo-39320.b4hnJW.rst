Replace four complex bytecodes for building sequences with three simpler ones.
Four bytecodes have been removed: ``BUILD_LIST_UNPACK``, ``BUILD_TUPLE_UNPACK``, ``BUILD_SET_UNPACK`` and ``BUILD_TUPLE_UNPACK_WITH_CALL``.
Three bytecodes have been added: ``LIST_TO_TUPLE``, ``LIST_EXTEND``, ``SET_UPDATE``.
