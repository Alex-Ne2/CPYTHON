When passing an empty iterable to min/max function, such
as min(set()), it returns the error 'arg is an empty sequence'.
'arg' does not match any argument of the functions signature.
Also, the iterable argument does not need to be a sequence.
This commit changes that error message to:
'iterable argument is an empty sequence'.
