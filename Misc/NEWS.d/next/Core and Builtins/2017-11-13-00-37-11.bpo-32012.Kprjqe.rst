SyntaxError is now correctly raised when a generator expression without
parenthesis is passed as an argument, but followed by a trailing comma, or
it is used instead of an inheritance list in a class definition.
A generator expression always needs to be directly inside a set of parentheses
and cannot have a comma on either side.  The duplication of the parentheses
can be omitted only on calls.
