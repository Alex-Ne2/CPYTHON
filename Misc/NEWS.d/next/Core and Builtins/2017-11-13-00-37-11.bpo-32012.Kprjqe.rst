SyntaxError is now correctly raised when a generator expression without
parenthesis is passed as an argument, but followed by a trailing comma, or
it is used instead of an argument list in a decorator expression, or
instead of an inheritance list in a class definition.  A generator expression
always needs to be directly inside a set of parentheses and cannot have a
comma on either side.  The duplication of the parentheses can be omitted
only on calls.
