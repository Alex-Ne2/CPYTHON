Method calls on :class:`super` are sped up. The 2-argument form,
``super(type, obj).meth()`` is now nearly as fast as an equivalent
``self.meth()`` call. The 0-argument form, while still slower, is still
faster than in previous versions of CPython. Patch by Ken Jin, with
additional contributions by Vladimir Matveev.
