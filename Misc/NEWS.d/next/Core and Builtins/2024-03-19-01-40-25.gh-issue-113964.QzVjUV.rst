Restores the ability to spawn threads from :mod:`atexit` handlers. The
interpreter finalization code will join non-daemon threads spawned from that
context before exiting.  No atexit handlers can be registered once atexit
handler processing has started and none will remain to run after threads
spawned during atexit processing exit.
