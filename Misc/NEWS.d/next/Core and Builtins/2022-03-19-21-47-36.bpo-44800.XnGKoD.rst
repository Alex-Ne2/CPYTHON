Renamed ``_PyInterpreterFrame`` as ``_Py_frame`` to emphasise its close
association with ``PyFrameObject`` (they're conceptually the same thing, but
split into a Python object struct and a C data struct as a performance
optimisation). ``_PyInterpreterFrame`` is retained as a compatibility alias
to avoid any disruption to the Python 3.11 performance improvement work.
