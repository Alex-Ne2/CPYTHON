Renamed ``_PyInterpreterFrame`` as ``_Py_frame`` to emphasise its close
association with ``PyFrameObject`` (they're conceptually the same thing, but
split into a Python object struct and a C data struct as a performance
optimisation).

The ``f_`` prefix has been removed from all ``_Py_frame`` fields that previously
used it, so the presence or absence of the prefix provides a way to infer
the exact type of a frame pointer when reading an isolated snippet in a code
diff.
