Refactored internal APIs for the new lazy frame object creation to more
consistently distinguish between the full ``PyFrameObject`` Python object
implementation that is still used in the Python and C runtime state
introspection APIs (function prefix ``PyFrame``, field prefix ``f_``, typical
variable names ``frame`` and ``f``) and the new ``_Py_framedata`` internal
frame data storage (C structs with no intrinsic instance lifecycle management)
that is now used for code execution (function prefix ``_Py_framedata``, no
field prefix, typical variable name ``fdata``).
