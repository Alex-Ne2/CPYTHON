Multi-phase init extension modules may indicate to the runtime that they can
run without the GIL by providing ``Py_MOD_GIL_NOT_USED`` for the ``Py_mod_gil``
slot. In ``--disable-gil`` builds, loading extensions that do not provide this
slot will enable the GIL for the remainder of the current interpreter, unless
the GIL was explicitly disabled by ``PYTHON_GIL=0`` or ``-Xgil=0``.
