`PyFrame_FastToLocalsWithError` and `PyFrame_LocalsToFast` are no longer
called during profile nor tracing. C code that accesses the `f_locals` directly
(which is not recommended) must now call
`PyFrame_FastToLocalsWithError` to update locals and `PyFrame_LocalsToFast`
after `PyFrameObject.f_locals` are updated.
