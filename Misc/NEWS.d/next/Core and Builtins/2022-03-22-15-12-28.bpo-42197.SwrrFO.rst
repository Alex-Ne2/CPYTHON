``PyFrame_FastToLocalsWithError`` and ``PyFrame_LocalsToFast`` are no longer
called during profile nor tracing. C code that accesses the ``f_locals`` attribute
 directly (which is not recommended) must now call
``PyFrame_FastToLocalsWithError`` to update locals and ``PyFrame_LocalsToFast``
after ``f_locals`` are updated.
