line 79, 109, and 193 used int to define functions, yet the return values only need to be short int.
line 80, 110, and 194 used int to define chars, however, this leads to the overhead of memory.
I really want this to be corrected or implemented because this can cause a little bit of improvement in the code performance, and I really desire to make Python faster, from my little bit of contribution.
