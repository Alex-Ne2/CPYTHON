Merge the Tier 1 (bytecode) and Tier 2 (micro-ops) interpreters together,
moving the Tier 2 interpreter loop and switch into
``_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()`` in ``ceval.c``.

**Beware!** This changes the environment variables to enable micro-ops and
their debugging to ``PYTHON_UOPS`` and ``PYTHON_LLTRACE``.
