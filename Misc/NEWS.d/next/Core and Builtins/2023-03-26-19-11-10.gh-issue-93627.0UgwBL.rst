Update the Python pickle module implementation to match the C implementation of the pickle module and update the implemetation of the copy module to match the pickle module conventions. For all modules reduction settings methods like `__reduce_ex__` or `__reduce__` to `None` will result in a `TypeError` with pickling or copying an object.
