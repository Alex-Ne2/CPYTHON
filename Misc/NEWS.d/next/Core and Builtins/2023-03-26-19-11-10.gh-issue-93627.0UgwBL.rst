Update the Python pickle module implementation to match the C implementation of the pickle module and update the implementation of the copy module to match the pickle module conventions. For all modules setting reduction methods like ``__reduce_ex__`` or ``__reduce__`` to ``None`` will result in a ``TypeError`` with pickling or copying an object.
