Fix regressions for extension modules that have been converted to :ref:`heap
types <heap-types>`. Inheritance differs for *static types* and *heap
types*: A *static type* with its :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_new` set to
``NULL`` does not have a public contructor, but *heap types* inherit
contructors from their base classes, resulting in it being possible to
create instances without proper initialisation, possibly resulting in a
crash.
