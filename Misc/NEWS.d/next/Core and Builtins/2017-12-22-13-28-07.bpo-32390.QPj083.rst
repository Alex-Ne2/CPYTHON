Fix os.statvfs(path) on AIX
when _ALL_SOURCE is defined f_fsid member of the statvfs structure is a structure instead of unsigned long.
when _ALL_SOURCE is not defined f_fsid member of the statvfs structure is nearly identical to Linux
Error message: 1506-280 (S) Function argument assignment between types "unsigned long" and "struct fsid_t" is not allowed.
