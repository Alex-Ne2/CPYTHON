Classes and functions that unconditionally declared their docstrings
ignoring --without-doc-strings compilation flag no longer do so.

The classes affected are :class:`ctypes.UnionType`,
:class:`pickle.PickleBuffer`, :class:`testcapi.RecursingInfinitelyError`,
and :class:`types.GenericAlias`.

The functions affected are 24 methods of :mod:`ctypes`'s classes.

Patch by Oleg Iarygin.
