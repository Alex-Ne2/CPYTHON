Fix an off by one error in the bytecode peephole optimizer where it could read
bytes beyond the end of bounds of a bytecode array when removing unreachable
code after a return.  This did not always crash an interpreter, but could.
An interpreter compiled using the clang memory sanitizer always failed.
This bug was present in every release of Python 3.6 and 3.7 until now.
