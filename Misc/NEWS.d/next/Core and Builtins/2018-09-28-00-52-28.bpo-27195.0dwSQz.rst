Access to the ``format`` of a ``memoryview`` object could crash if the
corresponding field in the buffer structure was not set. Per documentation
of the new-style buffer protocol, an unset ``format`` field is to be
interpreted as ``"B"``, so that is now returned in this case.

Patch by JP Sugarbroad.
