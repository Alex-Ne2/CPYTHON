Restore runtime compatibility with bytecode files generated by CPython 3.5.0
to 3.5.2, and adjust the eval loop to avoid the problems that could be
caused by the malformed variant of the BUILD_MAP_UNPACK_WITH_CALL opcode
that they may contain. Patch by Petr Viktorin, Serhiy Storchaka, and Nick
Coghlan.
