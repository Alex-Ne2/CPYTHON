The "small int" optimization is now unconditionally enabled.  This
optimization was introduced in Python 1.0.1, and means that :class:`int`
values from -5 through 256 are pre-initialized rather than constructed on
demand.  The option was always enabled unless certain never-documented
preprocessor macros were defined to 0 at build time; now it is always
enabled, simplifying the logic.  Patch by Greg Price.
