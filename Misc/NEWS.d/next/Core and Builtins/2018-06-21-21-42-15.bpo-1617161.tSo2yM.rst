The hash of :class:`BuiltinMethodType` instances (methods of built-in
classes) no longer depends on the hash of *self*. The hash and equality of
:class:`ModuleType` and :class:`MethodWrapperType` instances (methods of
user-defined classes and some methods of built-in classes like
``str.__add__``) no longer depend on the hash and equality of *self*.
:class:`MethodWrapperType` instances no longer support ordering.
