Replaced the ``FOR_ITER`` opcode that lived at the top of ``for``-loops with a
``FOR_END`` opcode that lives at the bottom. This form of `Loop Inversion
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_inversion>`_ replaces the (unconditional
jump, conditional jump) pair with just one conditional jump during most
iterations.
