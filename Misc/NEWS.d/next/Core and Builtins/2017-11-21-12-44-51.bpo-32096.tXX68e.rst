Since the recent global runtime state consolidation, calls to
PyMem_RawMalloc() and PyMem_RawFree() made before runtime initialization
have been crashing.  This is because they rely on the raw memory allocator
having been initialized already.  Before the runtime state change the
default raw allocator was initialized statically.  This has now been fixed
by falling back to the defaults in PyMem_RawMalloc() and PyMem_RawFree().
