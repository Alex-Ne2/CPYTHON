`PyObject_Call` now guarantees any kwargs `dict` passed is shallow-copied
before being passed to the callee, matching the documented equivalence with
`callable(*args, **kwargs)`, fixing #86795.     When a function call's sole source of
keyword arguments is a single `**`     unpacked `dict`, no copy is performed
when the callable uses the vectorcall     protocol and no copy is needed to
protect the caller's `dict` from mutation.
