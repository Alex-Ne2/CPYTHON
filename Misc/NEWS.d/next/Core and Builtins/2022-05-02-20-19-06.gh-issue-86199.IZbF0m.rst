:c:func:`PyObject_Call` now guarantees any kwargs :class:`dict` passed is
shallow-copied before being passed to the callee, matching the documented
equivalence with ``callable(*args, **kwargs)``.
When a function call's sole source of keyword arguments is a single ``**``
unpacked :class:`dict`, no copy is performed when the callable uses
:ref:`vectorcall <vectorcall>`, which does not expose the dict to the callee.
