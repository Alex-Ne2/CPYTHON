Add a ``=`` conversion feature to f-strings. This can precede ``!s``,
``!r``, or ``!a``. It produces the text of the expression, followed by
an equal sign, followed by the repr of the value of the expression. So
``f'{3*9+15=}'`` would be equal to the string ``'3*9+15=42'``.  If
``=`` is specified, the default conversion is set to ``!r``.  Added a
``!f`` conversion to switch back to the previous format behavior, if
needed.
