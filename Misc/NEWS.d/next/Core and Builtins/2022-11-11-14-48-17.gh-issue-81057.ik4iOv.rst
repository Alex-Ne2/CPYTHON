The docs clearly say that ``PyImport_Inittab``,
:c:api:`PyImport_AppendInittab`, and :c:api:`PyImport_ExtendInittab` should
not be used after :c:api:`Py_Initialize` has been called.  We now enforce
this for the two functions.  Additionally, the runtime now uses an internal
copy of ``PyImport_Inittab``, to guard against modification.
