Simplified the interpreter loop by moving the logic of unrolling the stack
of blocks into the compiler. The compiler emits now explicit instructions
for adjusting the stack of values and calling the cleaning up code for
"break", "continue" and "return".

Removed opcodes BREAK_LOOP, CONTINUE_LOOP, SETUP_LOOP and SETUP_EXCEPT.
Added new opcodes ROT_FOUR, BEGIN_FINALLY and CALL_FINALLY. Changed the
behavior of END_FINALLY.  WITH_CLEANUP_FINISH now includes END_FINALLY.
