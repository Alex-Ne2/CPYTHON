``wasm32-emscripten`` platform now include the Emscripten SDK version in
platform triplet and suffix for shared extension modules (``SOABI``).
Extensions with `.abi3.so` and `.so` are no longer importable. This avoids
problems with ABI incompatible builds or accidental mixing of ELF shared
extensions and WASM shared extensions.
