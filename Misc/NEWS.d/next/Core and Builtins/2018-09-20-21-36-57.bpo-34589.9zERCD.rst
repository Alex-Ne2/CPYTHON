The locale coercion implementation has been adjusted back to being closer to
the design documented in PEP 538. This means locale coercion is once again
solely the responsibility of the application embedding the CPython runtime
(in CPython's case, the CLI wrapper), with the runtime only providing
support to detect legacy locales, actually apply the changes needed to
coerce the locale to a UTF-8 based one, and to emit warnings when requested
via PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=warn.
