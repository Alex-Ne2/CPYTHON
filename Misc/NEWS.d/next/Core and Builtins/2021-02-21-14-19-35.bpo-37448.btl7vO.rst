Add a radix tree to track used obmalloc arenas. Use to replace the old
implementation of address_in_range(). The radix tree approach makes it easy
to increase pool sizes beyond the OS page size. Boosting the pool and arena
size allows obmalloc to handle a significantly higher percentage of requests
from its ultra-fast paths.

It also has the advantage of eliminating the memory unsanitary behavior of
the previous address_in_range(). The old address_in_range() was marked with
the annotations _Py_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS, _Py_NO_SANITIZE_THREAD, and
_Py_NO_SANITIZE_MEMORY. Those annotations are no longer needed.
