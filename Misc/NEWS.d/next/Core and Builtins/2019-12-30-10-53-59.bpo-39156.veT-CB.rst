Split the COMPARE_OP bytecode instruction into four distinct instructions.
``COMPARE_OP`` now handles only rich comparisons.
``IS_OP`` does 'is' and 'is not' tests.
``CONTAINS_OP`` does 'in' and 'is not' tests.
``JUMP_IF_NOT_EXC_MATCH`` is for checking exceptions in 'try-except' statements.
This improves the clarity of the interpreter and should provide a modest
speedup.
