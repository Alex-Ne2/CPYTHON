Starting new threads and process creation through fork/vfork at interpreter exit is no longer supported, as it can lead to race condition between main Python thread freeing existing thread states and :func:`_thread.start_new_thread` trying to allocate and use state of just created thread or fork/vfork trying to use main thread state in child process.
