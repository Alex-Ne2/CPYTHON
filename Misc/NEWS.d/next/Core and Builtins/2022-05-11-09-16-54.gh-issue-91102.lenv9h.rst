8-argument :meth:`_warnings.warn_explicit` is ported to Argument Clinic.
Benefits:

1. :c:data:`METH_VARARGS` calling convention is replaced with
   a little faster :c:data:`METH_FASTCALL` (no extra tuple creation)
2. :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords` call is replaced with
   :c:func:`_PyArg_UnpackKeywords` and a tailored parser generated specially
   for the ported function.
