Avoid falling back to the deprecated Apple-supplied system Tcl/Tk 8.5 on
macOS builds as this version is known to have many critical problems and
causes Python test suite failures. This last-ditch fallback behavior was
removed in Python 3.11 but is still causing problems for users and Python
release testing for older security-fix-only branches like this one. With
this change, building of `_tkinter` on macOS will be skipped if no other
versions of Tcl/Tk can be found.
