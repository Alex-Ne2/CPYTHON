Set __file__ while running a startup file. Like Python, IDLE optionally runs
1 startup file in the Shell window before presenting the first interactive
input prompt.  For IDLE, -s runs a file named in environmental variable
IDLESTARTUP or PYTHONSTARTUP; -r file runs file.  Python sets __file__ to
the startup file name before running the file and unsets it before the first
prompt.  IDLE now does the same when run normally, without the -n option.
