Issue #23883: Added missing APIs to __all__ to match the documented APIs
for the following modules: calendar, csv, enum, fileinput, ftplib, logging,
optparse, tarfile, threading and wave.  Also added a
test.support.check__all__() helper.  Patches by Jacek Ko≈Çodziej, Mauro
S. M. Rodrigues and Joel Taddei.
