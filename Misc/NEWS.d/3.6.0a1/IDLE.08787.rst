Issue #24820: IDLE now has an 'IDLE Dark' built-in text color theme.
It is more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
Strings, comments, keywords, ... are still green, red, orange, ... .
To use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the
'Save as New Custom Theme' button and enter a new name,
such as 'Custom Dark'.  The custom theme will work with any IDLE
release, and can be modified.
