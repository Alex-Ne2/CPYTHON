Issue #16893: Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display.
The new idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html.
It looks better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released.
The tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Rose Roseman.
The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are deprecated.
