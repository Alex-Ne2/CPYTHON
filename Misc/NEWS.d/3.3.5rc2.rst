str.encode, bytes.decode and bytearray.decode now use an internal API to
throw LookupError for known non-text encodings, rather than attempting the
encoding or decoding operation and then throwing a TypeError for an
unexpected output type. (The latter mechanism remains in place for third
party non-text encodings)

Fixes a zipimport bug introduced in 3.3.4 that could cause spurious crashes
or SystemErrors when importing modules or packages from a zip file.  The
change causing the problem was reverted.

io.TextIOWrapper (and hence the open() builtin) now uses the internal codec
marking system added for issue #19619 to throw LookupError for known non-
text encodings at stream construction time. The existing output type checks
remain in place to deal with unmarked third party codecs.
