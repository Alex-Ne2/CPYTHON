- Issue #25626: Change three zlib functions to accept sizes that fit in
  Py_ssize_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT_MAX.  This resolves a
  regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than 2
  or 4 GiB.  The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress() max_length
  parameter, the zlib.decompress() bufsize parameter, and the
  zlib.Decompress.flush() length parameter.

  of datetime.datetime: microseconds are now rounded to nearest with ties
  going to nearest even integer (ROUND_HALF_EVEN), instead of being rounding
  towards minus infinity (ROUND_FLOOR). It's important that these methods use
  the same rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) == datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t).
  It also the rounding mode used by round(float) for example.

  PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() instead of calling the encode() method of the
  host, to handle correctly custom string with an encode() method which doesn't
  return a byte string. The encoder of the IDNA codec is now called directly
  instead of calling the encode() method of the string.

- Issue #25060: Correctly compute stack usage of the BUILD_MAP opcode.

- Issue #24857: Comparing call_args to a long sequence now correctly returns a
  boolean result instead of raising an exception.  Patch by A Kaptur.
