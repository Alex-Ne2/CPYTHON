/* Frozen modules initializer
 *
 * Frozen modules are written to header files by Programs/_freeze_module.
 * These files are typically put in Python/.  Each holds an array of bytes
 * named "_Py_M__<module>", which is used below.
 *
 * These files must be regenerated any time * the corresponding .pyc
 * file would change (e.g. compiler, bytecode format, marshal format).
 * This can be done with "make regen-frozen".
 *
 * That make target simply runs Tools/scripts/freeze_modules.py, which
 * does the following:
 *
 * 1. run Programs/_freeze_module on the target modules
 * 2. update the includes and _PyImport_FrozenModules[] in this file
 * 3. update the FROZEN_FILES variable in Makefile.pre.in
 *
 * (Note that most of the date in this file is auto-generated by the script.)
 *
 * Additional modules can be frozen by adding them to freeze_modules.py
 * and then re-running "make regen-frozen-all".  This can also be done
 * manually by following those steps, though this is not recommended.
 * Expect such manual changes to be removed the next time
 * freeze_modules.py runs.
 * */
