Keccak Code Package
===================

The files in kcp are taken from the eXtended Keccak Code Package.
The architecture specific header file KeccakP-1600-SnP.h has been renamed to
KeccakP-1600-SnP-opt32.h or KeccakP-1600-SnP-opt64.h.

The 64bit files were generated with generic64lc/libXKCP.a.pack target, the
32bit files with generic32lc/libXKCP.a.pack.
