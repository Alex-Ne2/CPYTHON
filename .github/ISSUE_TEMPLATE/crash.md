<!--
  Please do not submit this form if you encounter an exception being unexectedly raised from a Python function.
  Most of the time, these should be filed as bugs, rather than crashes.

  The CPython interpreter is itself written in a different programming language, C.
  For CPython, a "crash" is when Python itself fails, leading to a traceback in the C stack.
