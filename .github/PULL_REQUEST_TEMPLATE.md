# Pull Request title

It should be in the following format:
```
bpo-NNNN: Summary of the changes made
```
Where: bpo-NNNN refers to the issue number in the https://bugs.python.org.
If your PR is for issue 12345 in the bug tracker, then the bpo number is bpo-12345.

Most PRs will require an issue number. Trivial changes, like fixing a typo, do not need an issue.

# Backport Pull Request title

If this is a backport PR (PR made against branches other than `master`),
please ensure that the PR title is in the following format:
```
[X.Y] <title from the original PR> (GH-NNNN)
```
Where: [X.Y] is the branch name, e.g. [3.6].

GH-NNNN refers to the PR number from `master`.

# Other checklist

[ ] Link your GitHub account to b.p.o
[ ] If applicable, add a News file using blurb
