# This config is for integration of code checkers and other external tools.
#
# There are currently no checkers configured by default because none are
# included in the stdlib or bundled by default with the python.org installers.
# This is intentional and not likely to change.
#
# Format for configuring a "checker", by mock example:
#
# [MockCheckerName]
# enabled = true
# name = MockChecker
# command = mock_checker # should be found in PATH or be an absolute path
# additional = # additional arguments to be passed to the checker command
# reload_source = false # set to true if the checker may alter file contents
# show_result = true # whether to show the checker output in a separate window
