class ThreadPool(AbstractPool):
    """Asynchronous threadpool for running IO-bound functions.

    Directly calling an IO-bound function within the main thread will block
    other operations from occurring until it is completed. By using a
    threadpool, several IO-bound functions can be ran concurrently within
    their own threads, without blocking other operations.

    The optional argument *concurrency* sets the number of threads within the
    threadpool. If *concurrency* is `None`, the maximum number of threads will
    be used; based on the number of CPU cores.

    This threadpool is intended to be used as an asynchronous context manager,
    using the `async with` syntax, which provides automatic initialization and
    finalization of resources. For example:

    import asyncio

    def blocking_io():
        print("start blocking_io")
        with open('/dev/urandom', 'rb') as f:
            f.read(100_000)
        print("blocking_io complete")

    def other_blocking_io():
        print("start other_blocking_io")
        with open('/dev/zero', 'rb') as f:
            f.read(10)
        print("other_blocking_io complete")
