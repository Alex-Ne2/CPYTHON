Pegen Virtual Machine
=====================

The Pegen VM is an alternative for the recursive-descent Pegen parser.
The idea is that the grammar (including actions) is identical, but
execution does not use the C stack frame.  The hope is that this might
be faster, but this is far from given.  If it is clear that it will
*not* be faster, we should stop working on this project.

The runtime uses the same `Parser` structure as the recursive-descent
Pegen parser, and the same helper functions
(e.g., `_PyPegen_singleton_seq`).

The VM uses a stack to hold state during parsing.  The grammar is
represented by a few read-only tables.  This design may be familiar
from that of CPython's "ceval" VM.  The actions are represented by a
function containing a giant switch with one case for each action.

The grammar tables and the action function are meant to be generated
by a parser generator similar to the current one.  Because of the
actions, the generator needs to generate C code.

The primary VM state is a stack of `Frame` structures.  Each frame
represents a particular attempt to parse a rule at a given point in
the input.  The only state separate from the stack is a pointer to the
`Parser` structure.

The main state in a frame is as follows:

- `Rule *rule`   -- points to the rule being parsed
- `int mark`     -- the input position at the start of the rule invocation
- `int ialt`     -- indicates which alternative is currently being tried
- `int iop`      -- indicates where we are in the current alternative
- `int cut`      -- whether a "cut" was executed in the current alternative

State related to loops is described below.

Note that `rule` and `mark` don't change after the frame is initialized.

In addition each frame has a "value stack" where successfully
recognized tokens and rules are stored.  This uses:

- `int ival`     -- number of values stored so far
- `void *vals[]` -- values stored (the type is `Token *` or an AST node type)

A `Rule` structure has the following fields:

- `char *name`    -- rule name, for debugging (e.g., `"start"`)
- `int alts[]`    -- index into `opcodes` array for each alternative,
                     terminated by `-1`
- `int opcodes[]` -- array of opcodes and their arguments

All rules are combined in a single array; the index in this array
is used by operations that reference other rules.

The `opcodes` array is a sequence of operation codes and arguments.
Some opcodes (e.g., `OP_TOKEN`) are followed by an argument; others
(e.g., `OP_NAME`) are not.  Both are representable as integers.

Operations
----------

Most operations can succeed or fail, and produce a vaue if they
succeed.

If an operation succeeds, the value is appended to the frame's values
array (`vals`), and the VM proceeds to the next opcode.

If an operation fails, the VM resets the input to the frame's mark,
and then proceeds to the next alternative of the frame's rule, if
there is one, and the frame's `cut` flag is not set.  If the frame's
`cut` flag is set, or if its rule has no more alternatives, the frame
is popped off the frame stack and the VM proceeds with failure there.

Some operations manipulate other frame fields.

Calls into the support runtime can also produce *errors* -- when an
error is detected, the VM exits, immediately returning `NULL`.

### General operations

The following opcodes take no argument.

- `OP_NOOP` -- succeed without a value.  (Used for opcode padding.)

- `OP_NAME` -- call `_PyPegen_name_token()`; fail if it returns
  `NULL`, otherwise succeeds with the return value.

- `OP_NUMBER` -- call `_PyPegen_number_token()`; same as `OP_NAME`.

- `OP_STRING` -- call `_PyPegen_string_token()`; same as `OP_NAME`.

- `OP_CUT` -- set the frame's `cut` flag; succeeds without a value.

- `OP_OPTIONAL` -- always succeeds, but modifies the *previous*
  operation to treat a `NULL` result as a success.  (See below.)

These operations are followed by a single integer argument.

- `OP_TOKEN(type)` -- call `_PyPegen_expect_token()` with the `type`
  argument; processing is the same as for `OP_NAME`.

- `OP_RULE(rule)` -- push a new frame onto the stack, initializing it
  with the give rule (by index), the current input position (mark),
  at the first alternative and opcode.  Then proceed to the first
  operation of the new frame.

- `OP_RETURN(action)` -- call the action given by the argument, then
  pop the frame off the stack.  Execution then proceeds (in the frame
  newly revealed by that pop operation) as if the previous operation
  succeeded or failed with the return value of the action.

### Operations for root rules only

A grammar must have one or more *root rules*.  A root rule is a
synthetic rule that uses `OP_SUCCESS` and `OP_FAILURE` operations to
report overall success or failure.  Only root rules may use these
operations, and they must be used in the right format.

Each root rule must have exactly two alternatives.  The first
alternative must be a single operation (generally `OP_RULE`) that
stores a value in the values array, followed by `OP_SUCCESS`.  The
second alternative must be the single operation `OP_FAILURE`.

- `OP_SUCCESS` -- exit the VM with the first value from the `vals`
  array as the result.

- `OP_FAILURE` -- report a syntax error and exit the VM with a NULL
  result.

### Operations for loop rules only

For a loop such as `a*` or `a+`, a synthetic rule must be created with
the following structure:

```
# First alternative:
<one operation that produces a value, e.g. OP_NAME, OP_TOKEN, OP_RULE>
OP_LOOP_ITERATE

# Second alternative:
Either OP_LOOP_COLLECT or OP_LOOP_COLLECT_NONEMPTY
```

The values being collected are stored in a `malloc`-ed array named
`collections` that is grown as needed.  This uses the following
fields:

- `ncollected` -- the number of collected values.
- `collection` -- `malloc`-ed array of `void *` values representing
  the collected values.

The operations are defined as follows:

- `OP_LOOP_ITERATE` -- append the current value to the `collections`
  array, save the current input position, and start the next iteration
  of the loop (resetting the instruction pointer).

- `OP_LOOP_COLLECT` -- restore the input position from the last saved
  position and pop the frame off the stack, producing a new value that
  is an `asdl_seq *` containing the collected values.

- `OP_LOOP_COLLECT_NONEMPTY` -- like `OP_LOOP_COLLECT` but fails if no
  values are collected.

(TODO: additional operations to support `b.a+`.)

More about `OP_OPTIONAL`
------------------------

The `OP_OPTIONAL` flag is a "postfix" operation.  It must *follow* any
operation that may produce a result.  The normal way of the VM is that
if the result is `NULL` this is treated as a failure by the VM.  But
before treating `NULL` as a failure, the VM checks whether the next
operation is `OP_OPTIONAL`.  If so, it treats `NULL` as a success.  In
this case a `NULL` is appended to the `vals` array and control flows
to the next operation.

When the operation preceding `OP_OPTIONAL` succeeds, `OP_OPTIONAL` is
executed as a regular operation, and always succeed.

Constraints on operation order
------------------------------

Note that for operations that succeed with a value or fail, there is
always a next operation.  These operations are `OP_NAME`, `OP_NUMBER`,
`OP_STRING`, `OP_TOKEN`, and `OP_RULE`.

These operations always succeed: `OP_NOOP`, `OP_CUT`, `OP_OPTIONAL`,
`OP_START`.

These operations must be last in their alternative: `OP_RETURN`,
`OP_SUCCESS`, `OP_FAILURE`, `OP_LOOP_ITERATE`, `OP_LOOP_COLLECT`,
`OP_LOOP_COLLECT_NONEMPTY`.

This operation must be first in its alternative: `OP_FAILURE`.

Grammar for lists of operations
-------------------------------

This shows the constraints on how operations can be used together.

```
root_rule: success_alt failure_alt

success_alt: regular_op OP_SUCCESS
failure_alt: OP_FAILURE

normal_rule: alt+

loop_rule: loop_start_alt loop_collect_alt

loop_start_alt: regular_op OP_LOOP_ITERATE
loop_collect_alt: OP_LOOP_COLLECT | OP_LOOP_COLLECT_NONEMPTY

alt: any_op+ return_op

any_op: regular_op [OP_OPTIONAL] | special_op
regular_op: short_op | long_op
short_op: OP_NAME | OP_NUMBER | OP_STRING
long_op: OP_TOKEN <token_type> | OP_RULE <rule_id>
special_op: OP_NOOP | OP_CUT
return_op: OP_RETURN <action_id>
```

Ideas
-----

We also need to extend the VM to support lookaheads.

- Positive lookahead (`&a`) -- add a new opcode to save the mark in a
  new frame field, and another opcode that restores the mark from
  there.

- Negative lookahead (`!a`) -- add another opcode that catches failure
  and turns it into success, restoring the saved mark.

- Left-recursion -- hmm, tricky...

Lookahead opcodes
-----------------

```
case OP_SAVE_MARK:
    f->savemark = p->mark;
    goto top;

case OP_POS_LOOKAHEAD:
    p->mark - f->savemark;
    goto top;

case OP_NEG_LOOKAHEAD:
    goto fail;

/* Later, when v == NULL */
if (f->rule->opcodes[f->iop] == OP_NEG_LOOKAHEAD) {
    p->mark - f->savemark;
    goto top;
}
/* Also at the other fail check, under pop */
```

If we initialize savemark to the same value as mark, we can avoid a
`SAVE_MARK` opcode at the start of alternatives -- this is a common
pattern.
