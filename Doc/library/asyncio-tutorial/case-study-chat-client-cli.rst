Asyncio Case Study: Chat Application (Client)
=============================================

WIP

.. literalinclude:: client05.py
    :caption: client.py
    :language: python3


TODO

Notes:

- using the streams API
- first show the client.
- will have to explain a message protocol. (But that's easy)
- then show the server
- spend some time on clean shutdown.
