:mod:`__future__` --- Future statement definitions
==================================================

.. module:: __future__
   :synopsis: Future statement definitions

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/__future__.py`

--------------

* To use a specific feature, import it from the :mod:`__future__` module using the
  syntax ``from __future__ import <feature>``. It is important to note that the
  ``__future__ import`` statement must be placed as the first statement in the
  source file, except for a module docstring.

* If a feature has been imported, the ``__future__ import`` remains valid even
  after the *MandatoryRelease* version. However, it has no behavioural effect.
  code will be compatible with multiple versions during the transition phase of
  a feature. If code only supports versions greater than or equal to the
  *MandatoryRelease* version, then no longer need to include the `__future__
  import` for that specific feature.

* Once a feature has been imported, :ref:`future<future>` import remains valid
  even after the *MandatoryRelease* version. However, it has no behavioural effect.
  So this code will be compatible with multiple versions during the transition
  phase of a feature. If code only supports versions greater than or equal to
  the *MandatoryRelease* version, then no longer need to include the
  :mod:`__future__` import for that specific feature.


.. _future-classes:

.. class:: _Feature

   Each statement in :file:`__future__.py` is of the form::

      FeatureName = _Feature(OptionalRelease, MandatoryRelease,
                             CompilerFlag)

   where, normally, *OptionalRelease* is less than *MandatoryRelease*, and both are
   5-tuples of the same form as :data:`sys.version_info`::

      (PY_MAJOR_VERSION, # the major version number,"2" in "2.1.0a3"; an integer
       PY_MINOR_VERSION, # the minor version number,"1" in "2.1.0a3"; an integer
       PY_MICRO_VERSION, # the micro version number,"0" in "2.1.0a3"; an integer
       PY_RELEASE_LEVEL, # "alpha", "beta", "candidate", or "final"; a string
       PY_RELEASE_SERIAL, # the release serial number,"3" in "2.1.0a3"; an integer
      )

The release information for features is captured through *OptionalRelease* and *MandatoryRelease*.
The *OptionalRelease* records the first release in which the feature was accepted, and
*MandatoryRelease* records when the feature became part of the language. Once a feature is included
in a *MandatoryRelease*, modules no longer need a future statement to use the feature, but they may
continue to use such imports if needed.

.. method:: _Feature.getOptionalRelease()

   'getOptionalRelease()': This method returns the release information for the
   *OptionalRelease* of a specific feature.

.. method:: _Feature.getMandatoryRelease()

   'getMandatoryRelease()': This method returns the release information for the
   *MandatoryRelease* of a specific feature.

.. attribute:: _Feature.compiler_flag

   The *CompilerFlag* is a bitfield flag that should be passed in the fourth argument to the
   built-in function :func:`compile` in order to enable the feature in dynamically compiled code.
   This flag is stored in the :attr:`_Feature.compiler_flag` attribute on :class:`_Feature`
   instances.

No feature description will ever be deleted from :mod:`__future__`. Since its
introduction in Python 2.1 the following features have found their way into the
language using this mechanism:

   ``from __future__ import annotations`` was previously scheduled to
   become mandatory in Python 3.10, but the Python Steering Council
   twice decided to delay the change
   (`announcement for Python 3.10 <https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/CLVXXPQ2T2LQ5MP2Y53VVQFCXYWQJHKZ/>`__;
   `announcement for Python 3.11 <https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/VIZEBX5EYMSYIJNDBF6DMUMZOCWHARSO/>`__).
   No final decision has been made yet. See also :pep:`563` and :pep:`649`.
