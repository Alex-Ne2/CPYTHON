  What's New In Python 3.12
****************************

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

.. Rules for maintenance:

   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.

   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.

   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)

   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.

   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.

   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).

   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.

   * It's helpful to add the bug/patch number as a comment:

   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer in :issue:`12345`.)

   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the Mercurial log
   when researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.12, compared to 3.11.

For full details, see the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.

.. note::

   Prerelease users should be aware that this document is currently in draft
   form. It will be updated substantially as Python 3.12 moves towards release,
   so it's worth checking back even after reading earlier versions.

Pending Removal in Future Versions
==================================

The following APIs were deprecated in earlier Python versions and will be removed,
although there is currently no date scheduled for their removal.

* :class:`typing.Text` (:gh:`92332`)

* Currently Python accepts numeric literals immediately followed by keywords,
  for example ``0in x``, ``1or x``, ``0if 1else 2``.  It allows confusing
  and ambiguous expressions like ``[0x1for x in y]`` (which can be
  interpreted as ``[0x1 for x in y]`` or ``[0x1f or x in y]``).
  A syntax warning is raised if the numeric literal is
  immediately followed by one of keywords :keyword:`and`, :keyword:`else`,
  :keyword:`for`, :keyword:`if`, :keyword:`in`, :keyword:`is` and :keyword:`or`.
  In a future release it will be changed to a syntax error. (:issue:`43833`)


Removed
=======



Porting to Python 3.12
======================

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.

Changes in the Python API
-------------------------

* More strict rules are now applied for numerical group references and
  group names in regular expressions.
  Only sequence of ASCII digits is now accepted as a numerical reference.
  The group name in bytes patterns and replacement strings can now only
  contain ASCII letters and digits and underscore.
