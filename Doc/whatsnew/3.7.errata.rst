  Errata for "What's New In Python 3.7"
*****************************************

Below are a collection of corrections to the
:ref:`release notes for Python 3.7 <whatsnew37>`.

* The :ref:`claim <whatsnew37-pep563>` that PEP 563 would be implemented in
  Python 3.10 is incorrect, as that decision has since been deferred. See
  related mailing list posts by `Thomas Wouters <https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/CLVXXPQ2T2LQ5MP2Y53VVQFCXYWQJHKZ/>`_
  and `Barry Warsaw <https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/VIZEBX5EYMSYIJNDBF6DMUMZOCWHARSO/>`_
  for more information.
